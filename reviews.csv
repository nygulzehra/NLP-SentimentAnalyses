0,i don t really care for the iphone    i don t like how are you talking to the phone compared to the iphone   i had  i am pleased that it didn t work with my provider  i did not like the big plastic screen protector camera because it is hard for the phone two read your swipe s  it shipped immediately as soon as you bumped it on anything  every single corner has chipped off of the thick plastic screen protector  i cared more about the memory and it being an iphone so i settled for this iphone    i am disappointed and wish i could ve gotten a newer version  but everything was on time and well packaged  and the other thing is the charging cord actually already broke end it felt to feet from my table to the carpet and snapped right off inside the phone  the card also kept reading on the iphone that it wasn t an apple product and would stop charging  those are minor things  but just thought i d give you a full review  and sorry to the seller who actually out the first few days  he did deliver what he promised  for the most part,4
1,i bought this as a trap phone since my parents took my other one and i was so worried that the phone was gonna be trashy because i looked through the reviews a little more after i bought it  on top of that i bought it at acceptable condition  but it s perfectly fine in the box   invoice sheets  an amazon renewed card    charger with a base  both working   and the phone wrapped in this hard inflated plastic stuff  kinda like bubble wrap but way safer  outside of the phone   veryy minor scratches on the screen that aren t noticeable unless i hold it at an angle and stare really hard  minor white scratches on the edges  a little dust dirt in the speaker and screws but not enough to be an actual problemafter turning it on   powered on like any regular brand new iphone     charged     battery capacity  touch id  home button  and all side buttons working  yes including the silence switch   cameras as good as they can get for an iphone   lol  good brightness  speakers working   isn t muffled  microphone working   isn t muffled  flashlight working  charging port working  location tracking  wi fi connecting  and bluetooth working   obviously  no sim card  but came with the holder for it  no screen glitching ghost tapping  i was so worried about this for some reason   came with ios       so i had to update it something that could be an issue for someone is that it says the carrier is  boost mobile      it isn t locked to it but says that   added a pic  i already use boost mobile  so it isn t much of a concern for me only issue is that i can t use my service  i went to my service providers site  same as what was listed as the carrier  boost mobile  and tried to swap the phones from my other one to this one  i ve done this before  it said  this device is not eligible to swap  i m not sure if it s an issue with the phone itself or my service provider  but that s the only issue i have  nice trap backup phone for     tax included ,4
2,i’ve had this phone for about two weeks now  when i received it  there were minor scratches on it  as stated in the description  no issue with that    the battery was at     and the buttons worked properly  after using it for these past two weeks  i havent noticed any issues  it came clean and with a charger and the power cube  not apple ones  just normal ones  all in all  i recommend getting this if you need or want a new  or should i say old  phone  read the description for the quality of the phone you’ll be receiving and understand that it’s cheap for a reason so dont be mad when there’s a scratch on your used phone,5
3,old out of date phone  but it gets the job done and then some   worth the money if you got a sim card and want to maintain phone number and other information while you look for that next gotta have phone  found a few small non important glitches in functionality cleared them up and operating systems all check out,4
4,broke my iphone   i had for   years  did not want to go back to android  so i decided to search amazon   came across the amazon renewed store and found an iphone i could afford   iphone   for less than      ok    ordered late morning on     and it was on my doorstep by   pm       not even   hours later    unlocked and in brand new condition   thank you so much   will definitely be back   and have been telling everyone about the renewed store on amazon  ,5
5, refreshed  is the new term for  pre owned   or  refurbished   and if you don t need bragging rights for owning the latest and greatest high tech device  this model of iphone   might just fit the bill  compared to the whopping prices demanded for the latest versions of the iphone  while these are not cheap  they are certainly much more affordable  and these iphones can perform the majority of the fancy stunts of the latest iphones with a few differences  including having to make do with    rather than   network speeds when it becomes widespread the two iphone   s we purchased arrived in good condition  one with a few minor screen scratches that we can live with  otherwise both intact and usable in every way  including with batteries that charged in the   percentile  health  status  the phones are unlocked and the two we received will work with both sim cards on gsm  or on  non sim card  cdma networks  we used the sim cards from our old phones using the  speed talk   t mobile  network  these sim cards came from cellular plans we bought from speed talk on amazon  and once the sim cards were inserted  the phones worked perfectly as of april    the iphone   supports the latest ios operating system updates  and hopefully will remain on apple s  security update  list for a number of years to come our experience with the two iphone   s   used in conjunction with a late model apple ipad   has us agreeing that apple has created an excellent interlocking system for personal communications  which explains the popularity of the iphone and its cousin  the ipad it is worth mentioning that the function of  icloud    apple s server farms  which serves as a continuous  free for five gigabytes of space  backup system for your  i  devices  also works as a means to share notes  photos  email  calendars  and contact lists and can be accessed online using a web browser from any computer  no matter what the operating system  appointments and contact information can also be added or modified while accessing the  icloud  account from a web browser  adding a great deal of functionality to the ios communications system  absent from web browser access is the ios  message  presence  apparently because apple does not want this popular message application being used or accessed on anything but  i  devices the iphone   s were simply but sturdily packaged with a  lightning  charging cable and a standard usb to   ac adapter enclosed  also  a tiny  sim card holder  release tool was in the box  with a short prong about the diameter of a paper clip that will release the sim card holder so you can insert your own micro sim card into side of the iphone  there was a walk through brochure enclosed of how to charge and power up the iphone  but if you are new to the methods of using one of these devices  you might want to visit youtube where there are lots of videos about using iphones  we had never owned  smart phones  before  but we picked up the skill set easily without too much trouble or much of a learning curve   going through the multiple settings and options takes some time and thought  but that can be done at your leisure  with cellular networks turning off   and earlier network connection configurations  the iphones were a good choice  with ios  message  and  facetime  options  as well as our use of a voip system that works through both the iphone cellular and wireless network  allowing us to save on cellular minutes by using wifi for sending and receiving phone calls the  refreshed  iphones work well and we find they are quite handy  though we have  to date  refrained from the habit we see everywhere of people quickly pulling out their smart phone at every opportunity and waving it around in front of their face  if we ever reach that point of insane phone mania  we ll have to go back to using a taut string with two tin cans for our communications ,5
6,i don’t jump to the newest phones whenever they come out  i had an iphone   for years  my wife got me an apple watch for christmas and it only worked with an iphone   or above  so i needed to upgrade to a iphone    didn’t want to pay full price of these phones  so i checked into a renewed one  the watch i got was also renewed and in very good shape  so i decided to try with a renewed phone  again  very satisfied with my purchase  a few minor scratches on the back of the phone  but once put into a case  can’t be seen  phone works great  no issues  and more importantly  works with my watch  my watch and this phone has made me a believer in buying renewed products  couldn’t be happier ,4
7,ordered the phone yesterday    so we got our phone and turned it on the battery didn’t have much juice in it so we had to charge it no big deal  it took all of   minutes maybe to switch everything over to mint mobile the phone pretty much did all the work we didn’t have to do much of anything  the phone works great very happy with the purchase it looks like brand new and i don’t know if they do this to all the phones but it had a screen protector already on it which was awesome because i had ordered some of those very happy with the purchase i highly suggest ordering ,5
8,i recently gave this seller a bad review and now am obligated to apologize   i couldn t set up the phone when i got it so i contacted a local apple store for help   long story short they basically told me it wasn t useable and obviously offered me no help   but i later found out from apple directly that it could have been fixed regardless of what the store employee made me to believe and they should have been able to help me with it ,5
9,no issues whit the iphone  bought as a gift and it’s been working well for the recipient  came clean  no noticeable scratches ,5
10,  update  the seller  hybrid it reached out to me and offered me several choices to make this right  i had assumed they were just trying to  slip one by   but after talking with them they seem like honest vendors who made a mistake  let me emphasize that other than low battery life left  the phone was perfect and unblemished  if i hadn t checked the battery life  i may have never known it  my apologies to hybrid it  i would buy from them again  regardless of my comment below and this ticks me off  at myself for one  i didn t check the battery before i set it up  it was a great looking phone and everything works  but battery life is    and the message from apple says  significantly degraded   but ticked off mostly to the seller  hybrid it  either they failed to even check the battery life  or they did check and decided just to sell it like that anyway  knowing it was below the guaranteed battery life  i have had good luck with these refurbished phones  but this seller ignored the rules and shipped something out of spec  i still think these refurbished phones are a good deal  just don t buy from hybrid it  and check the battery life left before setting it up ,3
11,bought this as a first phone for my middle school child  we use tello for the kids’ phone plans  worked like a charm  unlocked  charged right up and with the sim card from tello we were in business ,5
12,the phone is pretty good  i decided to switch to an iphone after using an android for years  my screen shattered on my previous phone  so i decided to try out an iphone and see how i like it  so far i am satisfied  i really can’t point out any negatives so far besides the phone being a bit small  if you’re looking to switch to an iphone from android  i would recommend the iphone    the seller also did a good job delivering the phone  it came in good protection and condition ,5
13,update  the seller offered several options to resolve our issue  we were pleased to be offered the choice of a full return or partial return to go toward the new battery  for the cost of the phone we were satisfied with the partial refund  i m changing our overall rating as a result got this for my   year old son to replace a very old ipod for christmas  he was very excited  as he s only had an ipod so far  unfortunately  the battery was not to be considered part of the  renewed  status on the phone  it was horrible and seemingly original to the phone  we thought we d return it  but knowing how old the device is and how expensive anything newer made by apple would be  we chose to keep not and replace the battery  this cost us an additional     which was actually a great deal   obviously a device this old isn t going to be anywhere near top quality  but you should know going in that you will need to replace the battery and add that into your mind for total cost before purchasing ,4
14,concerned about its water resistance,4
15,even though the battery was reading    under  battery health and charging   the battery would not last more than     hours of light use  i took it to the apple store and bought an oem battery for around     now it lasts all day and the phone that i received does work well  it is also in great condition  from the apple store scan  this iphone   was actually originally purchased in   so i was pleased it hadn t seen heavy abuse since its original release date      also  this is an at t iphone  and the sim card from my old iphone   did activate it without a problem   it also arrived with a screen protector and charge plug with cord  i would say if you buy this used budget for a new oem battery   do not buy the chinese ones and replace it yourself because it won t last  for around    used in excellent shape now with a new battery  this was a nice purchase and it was in better shape than expected ,4
16,value for money,4
17,great price  came clean and scratch free   i would buy from this seller again ,5
18,good condition phone works great,5
19,when the charging port on my old iphone se  first generation  went bad  i needed a replacement  but what  any new phone from apple costs a small fortune  yet buying a used or  renewed  phone from third party suppliers is always a gamble so with considerable trepidation  i searched amazon for  renewed  options  i knew that third party sellers   renewed  phones came with an amazon backed   day guarantee  but then i discovered amazon s  renewed premium  products  that s where hired techies put the product through rigorous restoration and  in the case of the iphones    point testing  after which amazon offers a full year s guarantee  for any reason  that generous guarantee  and the fact that amazon would ship the product directly  reassured me  i decided to buy only a phone covered by that  renewed premium  warranty in choosing  i wanted a step up from the first generation se and the dated iphone    i also wanted one whose battery could be recharged via a wireless charger  rather than those plug in ports  which can wear out  it s happened to me twice  i settled on the iphone      the silver model    gb  fully unlocked for all carriers  and of course with the renewed premium guarantee  its product page promised me  a like new experience   i figured that was probably a bit of an exaggeration    that any used renewed phone must have some deficiency  if only minor cosmetic damage or a less than    battery well  i m thrilled to report that by  like new   amazon delivered me a renewed iphone   that looks and functions as if it had just come fresh off apple s manufacturing assembly line  i mean a gorgeous  pristine looking phone with zero defects  scratches  or cosmetic blemishes on its screen  edges  or back  after swapping the sim card from my old iphone se  the iphone   powered right up  and    as far as i can tell after several days of use    it functions perfectly in every respect  furthermore  even though amazon only promises that the phone battery will charge to at least     mine charges fully  to     in short  it s a phone indistinguishable from a brand new one    but at a far more affordable price of just a few bucks over    let me add that the phone wasn t casually swathed in bubble wrap and dumped into a cardboard shipping box  either  instead  it came packaged in a sturdy  amazon renewed  box    one that was custom designed to hold that model iphone  its charging cable  its wall plug  and a sim tray opening tool  each item was individually wrapped in plastic and fit inside its own designated slot in the box  this extra care in secure  well designed packaging was much more than i expected i ve experienced many good transactions for a lot of great products on amazon  however  this iphone   purchase may be my best experience yet   okay  except perhaps for the purchase of my own thriller novels  published via kindle direct publishing    but hey  i m biased   i eagerly recommend this particular model of the excellent iphone    purchased under the  renewed premium  option  with that guarantee  there s absolutely no downside risk  and i think you can confidently expect to enjoy a truly  like new  phone   robert bidinotto  author   the dylan hunter thrillers series,5
20,same as title,5
21,even though i purchased a renewed phone  i can t tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality   i didn t rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because i haven t  and probably won t  use those features   the battery life is sufficient for my activities  so it gets a   star rating   i don t play games or watch videos on it so far  since i m an old geezer  lol    but i do have a few  favorite apps i access from time to time   if you re not really tech savvy  like me  and can t figure out how to close the apps  just google the question and you ll find the answer   closing the apps saves the battery  naturally    i read where some were complaining about the battery life and  if they re not closing the apps  this may be the culprit  i had an old android before and would never go back since purchasing an iphone   i ve read the iphone is much more intuitive to use   now  i have demonstrated such to myself the camera is quite an improvement over the one in my android    the android couldn t flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing    i ve taken some really beautiful  true to color  imo  photos with the iphone    comparable to my expensive  for me  canon rebel and i don t have to change lenses for closeups  lol   phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically  too   i m still learning all the features of the phone  not just the camera  and will get more proficient over time i really  really  love my  new  phone and wouldn t hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again   this is the first time i ve purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used renewed phone  especially over the internet   i had absolutely no problem activating it  cell provider even gave me a free sim card  and no malfunctions for the two weeks  now  that i ve been using the phone   the only thing i would recommend to some reviewers buyers  who say their phone won t charge  is the plug will fit into the phone either way   i found out it will only charge one way  however   so  i marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since    the plug in my old phone would only fit one way  so i couldn t screw up  lol    also  there s a way to put the battery indicator  life percent and charging indicator  on the front of your phone  at the upper right corner    just google how to do this  too   easy peazy   that way  you always know if the phone is charging  by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol  and the percentage of charge    i think my old android had this feature on the front as a default   i had to direct the iphone to do this   that s not a complaint   there may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this  either  if they want it on their front screen  ,5
22,excellent deal   ,5
23,honestly i was a little skeptical at first purchasing an older iphone and expecting to work as new  i haven’t been disappointed  the battery life  was my main concern and for the age of the phone  i couldn’t ask for more  i have it set on low mode and the phone lasts me all day and still have    of battery left  i’m so happy win it and i just bought another one for my husband and plan to buy another one later for another family member ,5
24,good delivery  great product  excellent business,5
25,works well  minor scratches on the back of the phone ,4
26,battery life is    ,4
27,bought this for someone and they love the phone  it arrived in excellent condition and at a good price  very satisfied with this purchase ,4
28,good as new,5
29,my son loves his phone,5
30,amazing phone works good expet the batter health was at   not above   and there is scratches and no sim removal kit but overall works well,4
31,for a renewed product i am a bit surprised works great and fits my budget ,5
32,i order myself and my bf this phone and it’s was and is excellent just a couple scratches was all again these were refurbished phones but work amazing and batter life is really good ,5
33,great for my   young kids,5
34,for the price  it was a great purchase  i couldn t find any scratches or marks  and it looked good as new  it also came with a screen cover  which was nice  setup was easy  i ve noticed one or two glitches but nothing that isn t common with a cr apple  device so it s probably just the ios  reboots solved the issue  just like on a brand new device overall  i like the phone  a lot  and i d return to buy another from this seller if i m in the market for it my only critique is the battery  the description said the batteries of products were tested and met   percent capacity  but that was not the case  it said  service  as soon as i turned it on the first time  and it died immediately from    percent  after charging several hours  i purchased a battery separately at the same time because i figured it would give out sooner since it s a refurb  still  it wasn t   percent  not even close  if you know how to change the battery in an iphone then get a new battery and prepare to change it yourself  now the phone is  like new  ,4
35,i like the proformance  and the features  and used for every day uses,5
36,good price,5
37,battery doesn’t like to stay charged long on one of them but the second one works perfect,5
38,well i bought the phone and started reading the reviews i was hesitant at first but i atuck through and i got it  i was shaking when i got it because the reviews said it would degrade and break adter the warrenty  i like the phone though  about like a week or three after having it its really good  the battery came at    and overall i would say buy it   ,4
39,battery was actually at     otherwise it seems like a decent phone ,4
40,fingerprint works great  don’t know about facial recognition for       its a steal,5
41,follow up review  the company replaced the phone but i did have to contact them to get it done faster  i am pleased with the phone and i took off one star for the delay  just because i felt the phone should have been sent overnight automatically and because contact was difficult  i definitely think they do a nice job and would use them again original review  phone poorly packed  bubble wrap was thin and not sealed so phone arrived half in the wrap after bouncing around inside of box  after placing sim and powering  i discovered the touch screen didn t work  useless  i couldn t turn the phone off  but luckily  it couldn t charge either so by the time i get it to ups it should be dead  waiting an additional   hours for a replacement  we ll see how that goes  very disappointed after all the good reviews about this company i read ,4
42,not everyone can afford the latest iphones   i highly think they are overpriced  but i do like the brand so i decided to get a older refurbished model  so far it works really well  i have   days if there is a problem to return  it came in good condition with no damage and had the charging adaptor and cord ,5
43,perfect   simply inserted sim from broken t mobile android ,5
44,this phone not only works great  it looks great  there are no blemishes on it at all  the batter stays charged up  i m very impressed ,5
45,this phone looks brand new and works well   the negative is i wish the battery was replaced when the phone was re newed   the battery was shipped at    remaining life and my expectation is that within a year it will decline to    and run at reduced performance   i expect i will then just replace the battery but i wish i had taken more time to interpret the small print,4
46,very good,5
47,had my phone stolen  so had to replace and get up and running   delivery was very good   condition of the phone was good   not a big user of phone  but need for work and personal use   don t get into the newest technology so don t want to spend money on features i will never use ,4
48,arrived on time an it looks brand spanking new no marks on it  was less then a   minute setup an it’s all ready to go  with the mint plan that is… i highly recommend to those looking for great quality an service ,5
49,so far so good   day   ,5
50,got it for my niece  her exact words   i love my phone  it s great  i love my phone  omg  needless to say  good quality  having problems with imessage games  but other than that full stars ,5
51,it personal use  great price looks like new ,5
52,the phone came in beautiful condition  no cracks and all buttons work  only downside was a degraded battery  which is expected with a phone that’s   years old   overall a solid purchase for a starter phone or second line ,4
53,wonderful phone  i am very happy with my purchase  works great ,5
54,my work iphone died and i need to get another   i only use this phone for work only with teams  email  and soft two factor authetication for work  si i did not want to spend a lot of money   at first  i was very skeptical if ordering a refurb iphone without seeing it first  but a friend ordered one of these and was happy with the outcome  so i thought i would give it a shot the phone arrived faster then what was stated it would   the phone looked brand new  and the battery life was     my previous ohone the battery life was in the    i did not replace the battery  because the screen had a major crack on it  but it did what i needed until it just died  and it came with a charger and cable i had to charge the battery when i first got it   no big deal   after charging  i did an update  and then started adding the different tools i have had the phone for about two weeks  with no issues at all   if there are any issues  i will update this review ,5
55,this iphone is absolutely like brand new  i m thrilled ,5
56,i like the item and seller very much ,5
57,everything works n looks new awesome deller,5
58,i purchased the iphone   refurbished and works great  in excellent condition   would buy my next upgrade again as a refurbished version  thank you ,5
59,quick response from the seller  good customer service  fast delivery and received the product as described on amazon ,5
60,iphone     space gray unlocked gsmwhat came in the    iphone     space gray unlocked    lightning    usb    original boxwhat was not in the       sim card removal    user manualthe cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from apple  i cannot tell if these are originals earphoneshave always used   party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker phone conditionbody is in very good condition  there are paint flecks on the corners  maybe dropped on a hardwood floor  it is smooth to the touch  not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete  pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket screen conditionit came with a screen protector already applied  if there are any scratches i cannot tell  with the protector on  it looks pristine a bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and i had purchased a case and screen protector for it  i always protect the phone before it goes outside it’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one i’ll never know  i guess some don’t care  i have a spare screen protector now battery condition  battery health says    maximum capacity relative to when it was new     charge on startup even though capacity says     i am not having issues where i am out of juice early  over a day with moderate use  heavier use i would need to recharge around         pm  this of course is a ymmv setting it upphone was already reset  you set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory camerano scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp speakersno issues  sound is very good  no hissing  cracks or pops microphone  lighting portno issues  works phone came with ios       installed  so far i have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase  phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and i would have to agree  amazon tends to lump all the reviews together  regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who  it’s as if it was all sold by one seller   reviewers need to say who their seller was my seller was mobiledealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most   this phone debut at       tax on september       nearly   years later it is has seen a     price drop  i don’t need the latest and greatest  a gently used phone is just as good ,5
61,its really good over all no problems with it but the battery only lasts   to   hours before needing to charge again would recommend buying a new battery but its just not worth buying a new battery because then you have to pay for them to replace the battery but other then that its really good  would recommend buying a new charger broke after the first   days ,5
62,my old iphone died and i had to get a new phone in a hurry  i was stunned to discover that apple eliminated the home button on its phones after iphone    i didn t want to do without it so i had to find an iphone   at least as a substitute until i figure out if i want a more recent phone i tried verizon  ebay and scoured the web for an iphone   in at least very good condition  i also was wary about the reputation of the seller having once bought a used phone that turned out to have been stolen  it couldn t be activated the phone i bought appeared to be too good to be true  it was significantly less than one i had been considering on verizon and it was in better condition  and  even though we are right in the middle of the xmas rush  i got my phone a day early  it is in pristeen condition and i had no problem activating it on verizon i am thrilled ,5
63,from renewed product pov it was good  barely noticeable scratches on screen  battery health was     well packaged  can t ask for more from renewed product ,4
64,the battery is absolute trash  although the fact that the seller didn t charge it past    before shipping it off  when it was guaranteed to be no less than    when i received it  probably didn t help  so it was very much dead by the time it got to me  the charging block that it came with also didn t work  thank goodness i have plenty of spares lying around    but thankfully the cord did and does a good job at charging it  overall  satisfied  with this being my first iphone ever  and i knew going in the battery might be trash  so i had already looked up how much it was to potentially replace it  fyi guys  gals    non binary pals  apple will replace the battery for      at the time i posted this anyway     best buy is also a certified apple refurbisher  so you could get it done there as well  don t know how much it ll cost there though  i m still trying to figure this phone out  so i might update as i get more acquainted with this phone ,3
65,the iphone   looked like it was new out of the box  no scratches nor dents   the unit even had a very nice screen protector on it ,4
66,it looks and runs great time will tell   ,4
67,got for my wife when my old phone she was using broke down  this a great phone and mostly inexpensive,5
68,here is what is being kept from all potential customers    when any  smartphone  or  laptop  or anything else of this type of merchandise  the ability to work on any device depends on several issues  example     is there money that is still owed on whatever the device is   if so  someone could get away with selling it  but the debt will eventually catch up to the serial number  regardless of where it is  physically   regardless of if it has been re purchased or not it is also    impossible for any technically gifted team  such as amazon s highly boasted department they maintain to use in order to run the diagnostics  correct any problematic issues they find  in order to fairly price these highly monitored gadgets everyone needs to remember that each time they are offered to  trade in their old device  to get a price break if they purchase from whatever company  there are literally millions of other people being offered the exact same thing if what i m saying is put into question  go by any best buy store  and ask to get a tiny bit of information from anyone who is working in the geek squad  they are much more gifted in explaining what i m attempting to explain you could contact apple  where anyone who holds a position in apple leadership can also explain how many other different companies around the world who hold tariffs which allow them to hold rights to millions of apple devices  from financing them to help and support with troubleshooting one of their customers apple macs  iphones  iwatches  etc   guys  i am no different than any of you guys who fell for amazon s lies  i paid over    in mid   for an iphone      supposedly  renewed   and i never could get to the bottom of why it would quit allowing me to send an imessage with my iphone number  yet i could use my apple id  or either one of my icloud addresses  i would have to go back to verizon and have them insert a new sim card into the iphone every time it occurs i finally had a very savvy apple representative do a great deal of extra research with its information right there listed in the general section of my settings  what she located were the devices full history  and that as of march   the device had been locked   fyi  it is impossible for any locked device to be tested and receive true findings  and it s especially impossible for any device made by any company while it is in locked mode by that company to be  renewed  did you guys get that  amazon is and has been stealing all of our money by selling devices which are or have been locked by carriers my iphone   was locked by a company  located in tokyo japan  called softbank all you ve got to do is type softbank into your browser and you ll see that i m not dreaming one word of this up i imagine amazon is more than likely selling thousands of locked devices to it s customers if you ve ever heard the saying  whatever you do in the dark will eventually find it s way into the light    then it won t come as a shock as to  why amazon s stock plummeted to the tune of trillions  which reflected throughout each quarter in    sure  amazon will continue to be a fixture in millions of everyone s lives  but  i m not one of them  i have pushed myself away from the table  and excused myself  i m too full of what amazon has continually served me ,1
69,battery lasts a long time and it s in good condition  clean  solid  i mean it s not the latest but who cares  it has a button that only works when the phone is on so who knows how that works but it s weird  my old one button worked even when the phone was off ,5
70,,5
71,ok for the price  battery    and some of the stock apps are missing and i cannot find to reload,4
72,i bought the  renewed  phone with a rating of  excellent condition   i read the downer reviews  but decided that i trust amazon to describe an item honestly   this phone exceeds all of the descriptions   i could not find a scratch on the front or back   there were some tiny nicks where you plug in the lightning charger cord but  the greatest feature is the battery health     and it stays charged all day even when i m pounding instagram or other wifi intensive aps i have att and bought the  locked to att  phone   all i did was install my sim card from my old iphone and it came to life and works great i m very happy with this phone ,5
73,iphone   arrived with lots of tiny scratches on screen and and inch long gouge  putting a screen protector on over scratched screen doesn’t seem to qualify as refurbished excellent condition  should just say used  not refurbished if sending with scratched screen      battery health  without replacing battery  presume used phones are just checked to see if they work and sent to someone else  asked ray over phone for partial refund as device sent qualifies as fair condition not excellent  granted thanks i put phone in case   can buy new battery  worried camera occasionally freezes up… more affordable than buying new iphone ,4
74,bought it for my brother battery life weak but otherwise nice phone despite all my fears,5
75,the phone i have now works so well  it s in seemingly perfect condition  for what i paid for a used phone  i feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day  i wish i could give four stars  there were several communication issues  product issues that i felt took this order in a wonky direction      the order was sent to my address with signature required  when i asked to remove the required signature  i m not home all the time   the package was sent the next day to a location one state away  rather than spend another four to five days without a phone  i chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the fedex facility  okay     the first phone stopped working after a few weeks  believe me  being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue  i don t even have a phone at home  what if i had to call    my employer  etc   they gave me a very quick and flexible response  saying they would replace or return the phone  amazing response  they told me to remove my icloud info and delete the email app  which was impossible because it wouldn t even turn on  but no problem  they removed the icloud account and email when i turned it in somehow  however  they did not mention that i would have to hold onto the sim card so they sent me a new iphone  nice model  everything fine  except  no sim card      no sim card  by this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis  my carrier was closed except for in one location  fine  but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service  not fine   no phone   after all the drama i figured out how to call them without activation on my own  a few days later i got the sim  anyway  the new phone works outstandingly  the exchange was smooth  they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees  however the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery  the first phone battery stopping completely  and the lack of communication about holding my old sim card backed up my phone use  i m all set now though  four stars ,4
76,i use this for my work phone and to manage extra content  i dont use the face or fingerprint id stuff  it was a great price and i haven t had any issues with it whatsoever ,5
77,got this for my grandma who wanted an iphone  came perfectly packaged and ready i really thought it wouldn’t come in great condition but it was awesome ,5
78,phone look new,5
79,was in need of replacing my dying phone and found a great value in this phone   it is an older model but the quality of the phone was top notch   it was in excellent condition and i am still using this phone ,5
80,update   after i returned the first iphone  i ordered a second one   the second one came very quickly as well   this one came with    battery capacity and much less pitting and wear than the   one   since these are used phones  i guess it really just depends on the luck of the draw   i did notice the price increased a few dollars when i purchased the second one  so maybe there s something there  anyways  adjusted my review from   to   stars   the second phone deserves   stars  but since i had to go through the process of returning the   one  which forced me to switch phones   weeks later than i would ve liked  i say   stars is fair original to note  i am obviously returning this product  but will give time for the seller to make things right   i will change delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation to the seller s credit  this phone was delivered much faster than expected  almost a week early   however  what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn t as advertised   one of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed      that s directly from the description from the listing   imagine my disappointment when i go to settings and see the message  your battery s health is significantly degraded      maximum capacity        this is worse than the iphone   i currently have and was trying to  upgrade   and keep in mind i had my current iphone   for about   years now   completely unacceptable if even after all that  you still decide to purchase one of these  i should also mention  if you look close enough  you can tell you bought a used phone   this isn t to knock the seller or the product  it s clear you re not getting a new product  just shows minor signs of wear and tear ,4
81,phone seems to work well overall  issues initially with hearing voice when someone calls and i pick up  it seemed very quiet and i was unsure how to correct   i believe the sound was locked under settings   i don t seem to be able to adjust it any further even thought the volume controls are set at high  open button requires some pressure and many times i kept getting siri ,3
82,i bought this as a replacement phone for se originally but ended up upgrading it is over all a good phone however it dies really fast and the camera quality isn t really the best but despite those the phone is overall really good and arrived earlier than expected im truly happy with my purchase ,4
83,this phone was in great working condition  it was free of scratches as well  it was purchased for a friend who lost her phone  she loves it  ,5
84,loved it  qualitative phone for its price works really well  camera is good  overall good quality,3
85,worked okay for a few months then slowed down so much it almost had been thrown across the room  most apps can’t run because the processor i’m guessing  it will try it but then close the app  sometimes goes to a frozen screen and can’t do anything until you do a hard reset  this was my first refurbished phone and not impressed  even on   wi fi it’s slow  i know it’s this phone  because my work phone is just fine ,3
86,works as expected  condition was up to standards and all features seem to be working as advertised ,4
87,only dislike is it does not come with a real iphone charger two days after using the phone the charger breaks,4
88,good on all functions,5
89,my phone arrived in just one day but would not hold a charge for long   i replaced the battery and was issued a refund for the cost of the replacement   i’m satisfied   the seller customer service through amazon was on point ,4
90,this renewed iphone   arrived in good condition  there were no visible scratches and overrall the phone works great however  the battery does not hold up to the     capacity claim  after a few days of first activating it  the battery declined from    to     although the charge still lasts quite a bit  also  this specific unit seemed to have had the screen replaced at some point in the past  considering the brightness and pixel density is definitely not what is expected of an iphone  the phone works internationally and is not locked to any specific carrier  however i would ve still loved for the seller to be more honest with the battery capacity claim if you don t have the budget for a new iphone but still want the apple experience  i d recommend you to go ahead and purchase one of these renewed ones  although be advised that you will get what you pay for  so adjust your expectations accordingly ,4
91,bought this for my mother  it came in perfect condition  unnoticeable scratches on the back looks brand new ,5
92,this was bought for someone else they are verysatisfied,5
93,i enjoyed using the phone  it was perfect ,5
94,was not unlocked,4
95,just opened it today but all data transferred from old iphone s     to iphone   with no issues   looks new except tiny scratch on back of phone  not screen  sim card no problem to transfer  we’ll see how it holds up ,4
96,my daughter likes it works great,5
97,like to finally own another iphone not a android person,4
98,it come in early really good come with a charger took a minute to set everything up but i love this phone,5
99,okay,5
100,could not tell this was refurbished  looked new,4
101,battery life  ,4
102,i purchased this iphone    with the renewed premium guarantee  for my daughter   it arrived in excellent condition   however  the first day she had it  the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about      this happened again over the next couple days   i went into the battery settings  see attached screen shot  and found that the battery was seriously degraded  even though it was supposed to be in  similar to new  condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least      so i called amazon customer support for a replacement phone   it was a cumbersome process   the amazon representative had to contact apple  and he and i were on hold with apple for about   minutes   when the apple representative got on the line  the amazon rep left the call   the apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing   she then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out of warranty pricing to me for a new battery   i objected  stating that amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why i had to pay for anything at this point   she then had to talk with her manager  and again i was on hold for several minutes   she came back and said that i would have to talk with amazon about the phone   so i took the case number she gave and called amazon back   i was on hold again for a few minutes with amazon  but when the customer service rep came on the line  i explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately   i received the new phone the next day   it arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly   everyone i talked to  both at amazon and at apple  was very nice and easy to deal with  it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem   all told  i was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced   i am satisfied with the replacement  i just wish the process would have taken less time ,5
103,good for just a phone  battery life isn’t the best,4
104,received the phone as described and worked without any issues ,4
105,never thought i would say this    i have no idea what they put on my main screen  but i ve had this phone for over a year now and the back is completely trashed and broken but the front screen dose not have a scratch on it    i don t know but i feel super lucky and grateful     its been a hell of a deal,4
106,replaced my old phone    it s great    ,4
107,super pleased that this has no blemish at all  it was unlocked as promised   maybe battery life won’t be as great but it’s the same for any old phone  there is always the option to get a new battery   but mostly need it for my mom who doesn’t go out much  so far it works just fine  for the price i think i’m not going to buy new again ,5
108,battery life of only   percent ,3
109,i bought this as a temporary replacement phone when my iphone   stopped reading my sim card  at the time i couldn’t afford a new iphone so i bought a cheap replacement until i could buy a newer iphone model  the battery dies quickly  it states that it’s capacity is    and i doubt that to be true  my iphone   s battery life lasts so much longer and it’s battery capacity is at     the iphone   gets pretty hot when you use it for ten minutes straight  i had to carry a charger around with me all the time because one second i’m at    and maybe   minutes later it’s at     for the price i cannot be too disappointed  it did it’s job until i got a new iphone but i do not recommend for permanent use  other than that the iphone   looked great  no scratches or cracks  camera and speakers worked great  so i will give two stars for that  my main complaint is the battery life ,2
110,i had the phone one day and noticed that the battery did not seem to last  the main reason i was looking to replace   while it as advertised batteries are to be above     the phone came at     they offered my to return it but is was just disappointing that it made it through quality control  i saw in the reviews this also happened to someone else  although they gave them a partial refund   other than that the phone was great but i only used it   days ,3
111,amigo o amiga si usted fue como yo interesado en comprar un iphone renewed este es su review  lo primero es que notas que hay demasiados review negativos  algunos tienen buenas bases y otro son una locura como molestarse porque el iphone llego con alguna raya tiene que entender que son iphone de segunda mano  si ya entendio eso puede seguir leyendo  el truco aca es comprarle a un vendedor confiable muchos compradores en amazon no saben que puedes escoger el vendedor en la lista cuando revisa un articulo  yo por lo menos le compre a ti hibryd    de reputacion  las fotos hablan por si solas  equipo en excelente condiciones  completamente desbloqueado  veo que muchos compradores adquieren iphone con vendedores poco fiables con   a    de calificaciones positivas y pasan malos momentos  si ti hybrid me costo    mas pero es mejor pagar esa diferente que arriesgarte con otro vendedores  porque si sale dañado es dificil una devolucion desde latam es demasiada cara   el iphone vino con cable y cargador genericos nuevos  no son originales pero parecen de buena calidad  el unico detalle fue que la bateria llego con    algo baja pero aun por arriba de la descripcion que indica que va a ser superior a        el truco aca es comprarle el iphone a un vendedor con al menos     doy   estrellas por el uso de la bateria por el precio creo que debio ser igual o por arriba del       actualizare mi review en unos cuantos meses para saber si el equipo funciono sin problema,4
112,love my phone  but disappointed with the battery  to be fair  it was stated that the battery life would be no lower than     mine was       the battery can’t even make it thru the day   i am retired and not on my phone endlessly    i now have to buy a new battery  i think it would be better to pay a bit more for the phone  although this phone was not cheap  and have a new battery  even though i really like my phone  my focus is on the negative due to my battery ,4
113,i am very pleased with my purchase  phone came in small box encased by a thin layer of plastic  along with a generic charging brick and cable  however the phone was not secure in the box and was sliding around with slight movement  thankfully the phone was not broken in any way the phones appearance and functionality  the screen and the back glass are flawless and the camera lens is perfect  there are very minor scuffs near the charger port  which is not a issue at all for me because i always have a case on so you can t see the small scuffs  all of the buttons  silent on off switch  and touch id work great  functionality wise this phone runs beautifully  no problems with it so far at  but the battery health is lower than advertised  advertised at     health or higher  mine came at    health should you buy this phone  in my opinion yes  if you can handle minor cosmetic imperfections and lower than advertised battery health this is a wonderful phone for the price and functionality ,4
114,it’s a great product for the price,5
115,this is the second time we ordered through them and received a phone  first one   we had no problems with  second one we received it and it has bad speakers  you can barely hear the phone  now we are having charging problems   would not recommend as we paid a lot of money for a used phone that was supposed to be checked and obviously wasn’t ,5
116,the phone stopped charging and after prolonged cleaning with a floss pick  specifically sticking it all the way through the middle pins  it finally started working again   hope this helps others   it took quite a while of cleaning as i focused on other parts of the port  because the pins looked clean  but were still blocked  ,4
117,i really love the camera,5
118,no problem with phone but who ever left it they left out on the road leaning up against my mail box pole i am just lucky somebody didnt stop and take it this isnt accetable at all,3
119,good phone,5
120,phone arrived early  appears to be in excellent condition  just super bummed that included charger doesn’t work  otherwise  good experience ,4
121,it’s refurbished but it looks excellent  easy to install sim card and program it to my network and off i go enjoying it ,5
122,i bought this phone to replace a cheap galaxy   which ran out of storage space after a few videos    gig vs   gig    i saw the iphone had a different size sim than the galaxy so i ordered a new sim from verizon at no cost and got it one day after i got the phone   i charged the iphone for several hours and started the activation   wouldn t activate and i talked to   or   verizon people over two days  and long waits for a tech    the last guy said he could see the phone and the sim on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone  so i sent it back and said i would try another  the people at kiss were nice and got me a different phone    both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed   guess what   still wouldn t activate   after over an hour wait on dec    the verizon tech said i needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal   this immediately made sense to me  why didn t the other verizon techs figure this out    after a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower  the phone activated in about   seconds   amazing  right   not exactly   i got back home and couldn t do anything over wifi   the next morning i got to speak to a tech  right away but no solution   the next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem   guess what  i had to go back to the tower to get a strong lte signal to activate wifi   the phone works fine now and i m very happy with it   kiss gets good marks and verizon needs to know some people don t have cell service at their home ,5
123,it requires me to use it as a microphone when iam talking   to put it on the mouth  because people don t hear me when it s on the ear,3
124,works great  pretty fast too  crashed when i first booted it up but thats normal for a refurbished apple product  or just low battery aswell  no scratches  fingerprint marks or anything on the front and back  only thing is dust was along the charging port  i suggest to anyone who plans to use this as a main phone though that they buy a proper apple charger  the generic one given with it charged really slow and had issues with charging at first  the only thing i have against it really is the amount of dirt and dust  but other than that the phone works perfectly and   runs great on it too ,5
125,the  rate features  section asked about the fr and fr    i do not use the facial recognition or the fingerprint reader    totally invasive bs  imo     apart from the aforementioned    i like the phone ok  but this phone s battery lasted only     months before it became incapable of holding a battery charge at all   i m hoping i can use apple s magsafe charger rather than having to replace the battery    ,4
126,perfect first phone for my son   works great without the price tag of a new phone ,5
127,could be be better battery,4
128,i was very anxious about buying online again  last phone  within   days  was horrible  this phone so far has me pleasantly surprised  pros  not one scratch or crack  very fast processingcons  the battery  is only     when it was promised    or better  and the sim card slot didn’t fit inside all the way i had to used the sim slot piece from a previous phone  but it did work thank goodness if not this would have been another amazon fail  but i was able to save it myself  just beware  any changes will update ,4
129,i can’t believe that i can buy a refurbished iphone in such a good condition  all parts seems and feels to be genuine  screen is flawless with true tune enabled  fingerprint sensor worked  camera  microphone gyroscope and flashlight work great  battery health is around     front and back glass are intact  nothing to complain about this phone  feels happy to have it with just     bought one refurbished iphone   from another seller at about    and that phone even doesn’t have functional microphone and speaker  more surprisingly  that phone suddenly powered off and never turns on again  got refund on that order  i have to say this must be the best reseller  if you want to buy one refurbished iphone  you should choose this one ,5
130,phone works great  customer service is excellent ,5
131,everything went smooth   product was what we were looking for at a good price ,5
132,amazon said the battery would be at least     but it was less than    when i got it  other than that  it’s a great phone ,4
133,product came in before the time it was supposed to product was in great shape no complaints   stars would definitely recommend as well as buy from them again had the product for     weeks   no issues ,5
134,the phone works perfectly  the battery life isn t as good as new  but this isn t a new phone   there were no scratches or visual defects   everything works   it s been a couple of years since we bought it and it is still working well ,4
135,upgraded from iphone     i was able to use the same sim card for at t   phone is in excellent condition  no glitches  cracks  or issues  battery charges to    and holds its charge    i enjoy having a slightly larger screen size and still being able to fit it in my pocket  i highly recommend this seller  the phone arrived in just a few days  was packaged appropriately with cord and adapter included ,5
136,works great so far  looked like a new phone  like it wasn t used  overall great so far  i ll update of any changes,4
137,pero la batería refurbished no es muy duradera,3
138,liked all ,5
139,update   almost   months later  phone is still working great with no issues i received my iphone three days earlier than expected  phone is in pristine condition  battery life at     the charger did not work but i have others  i am very pleased for this short time i have used it  i haven’t used a renewed phone from amazon or anywhere before  but decided to chance it and i’m glad i did   i will update if i run into any problems  but i am very happy at this time ,5
140,no major issues so far  appreciate the quality of the refurbished product ,4
141,i had an iphone   and upgraded to the refurbished iphone     i am very happy with the upgrade and it is perfect for a senior citizen   the phone looks brand new ,5
142,overall  the look is good  although there are one or two noticeable scratches on the screen  there s a bit of aging at the corners of the screen  battery health is     which is just below     but it is acceptable considering the price is a bit lower for   than      it s still waterproof  not tested underwater completely  ,4
143,phone did not hold charge,4
144,got   for my daughter s birthday and she loves it   absolutely a great deal,4
145,the battery life is awful   with a full charge  it drops rather quickly with no use and all apps cleared ,3
146,my son accidently dropped his iphone   in the pool   he asked me for a new phone   i mistakenly ordered the iphone     nonetheless  the phone arrived quickly and looked brand new   i was about to set it but my son said that it looked smaller than his drowned phone    it is smaller compared to the      i realized my mistake  repackaged the phone and started an amazon refund  i assured the seller via e mail that we had not set up the phone and that the phone was being returned in its original package   we received a full refund upon the receipt of the phone   very pleased with service ,5
147,i believe  what amazon say the phone it’s excelente no scratches and battery its    and unlocked and works with metro,5
148,received phone  was really surprised for it looked and operated like new  no scratches or blemishes  i hesitated at first due to some bad reviews but took a chance and was well worth it   i would definitely buy from same seller seller again  great deal  super low price for like new iphone  fast   day delivery  been using it for over a week now  no issues  finger print reader was new to me  works great thank you ,5
149,upon opening the box there is a packet of information with  open me first  on it   if you do that the set up is flawless   once you turn on your new used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings  address book and apps in a matter of minutes  it could not have been any easier  you then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it s ready to use  on the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least    or better  to my surprise it s at      the iphone itself looks like it s a new phone  not a scratch on it  it even has a month or so left on the original apple warranty from whoever owned it before   i ve been wringing it out  texting  taking pics  making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone   plus didn t have and so far so good   while i liked the bigger screen on the   plus i could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me   i don t know if all renewed premium phones are like the one i got but i m really impressed  better yet i have a full year to put it through it s paces   i wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank   my hats off to amazon and the tech   mm in new jersey that tested and signed off on the   point inspection certificate  nice job on an outstanding phone ,5
150,phone looks absolutely new  not a mark or a blemish anywhere on it battery holds up well   seemed to work perfectly  except my voice level on calls was so low that nobody could hear me   i cleaned and even blew out the microphone with air and nothing helped   took it to a repair store and they cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol   now it s working perfectly   if it happens again it s going back to amazon i would have given it   stars but l feel l shouldn t have had that problem with an amazon  renewed  phone   obviously somebody dropped the ball and didn t check out the outgoing voice level  perhaps amazon should add this to their  renewal  procedures   i don t appreciate the trouble it caused me ,4
151,love it   works perfectly   no damages   would order again from company   so happy  ,5
152,has a guarantee and works great ,5
153,i ordered this iphone specifically because  its advertised as renewed  the condition of the iphone i received was  to the untrained eye  half renewed  upon inspection  i saw the top left of the display where the mute switch is located  to be slightly lifted  i thought the worse  a bad  swollen battery  when i would press into the screen it looked as if something was pushing it up  confused and worried  i went ahead and turned the display to full brightness to see if the battery  would drain too fast  surprised to watch netflix on full brightness i got   hours untill i hit    battery  so i shut off the phone  and proceeded to take apart the screen  what i found was astonishing  firstly the battery was healthy and slim looking  second  i tried putting the screen back on correctly but i couldnt snap one side in without the other getting caught on the inner frame  upon further inspection the screws on the side that hold the display were extremely  loose and preventing the clips  on the side to go in and snap into place  i tightened them up on both sides and lined up the screen top side first  and it snapped into place perfectly  flat  i am disappointed the phone didnt come as advertised in the pictures in accordance to claiming the phones being renewed  summary  yes its an actual iphone  yes its fully functional  yes it looked new  no scratches  however  its obvious the phone screen was taken apart to either replace it  or replace the home button  or whatever reason to make it look new  but attention to detail was skipped with the loose screws that hold the lcd panel  and no new screen adhesive was applied to seal the phone and keep it looking actually renewed  im lucky i already  had a smartphone repair toolkit from home depot  to continue my phone  renew  procedures  any other customer who doesn t have the toolkit  or is afraid they might ruin their purchase  would probably give a not so constructive criticism review  but rather an upset  anger induced review  all in all im happy with the device and the quickness of the seller to ship the phone with fedex  from maryland all the way to my place in california ,3
154,just came in the mail  going to be for my son and daughter  appears to be working on wifi with no initial indications of blemishes  cord and plug are not apple  but are working  i will update review once i install sims ,5
155,it came sim unlocked and with no scratches  which sums up what i was looking for   battery life isn’t the best  but it’s to be expected with an older model  overall  happy with my purchase and will purchase again if needed ,5
156,excellent,4
157,product integrated smoothly into my carrier and my phone number ported right over without issue  great product ,5
158,i wanted to change to a new carrier that did not support my current phone  the carrier supports less than   phones and the iphone   is one of them  after looking at all the phones that would work i started narrowing them down by cost and power  this phone at   of internal memory for less than    was by far the best value  after reading the reviews i was a little concerned about appearance and battery life but that is definitely not a problem  the phone that arrived looked brand new  not a mark on it  i do not use a phone heavily  a little bit of internet surfing  a few calls and a few texts  before setting the phone up i left it turned on in standby mode for   hours and it still had most of the battery life left  when the new sim card arrived i gave the phone and full charge and started the setup  after setting up the phone  icloud  carrier  synching to old phone  downloading new apps i wanted and leaving phone on for   hours there was still over    battery life left  that is more battery life than i am likely to ever need  the only drawback i have found so far is the camera  when using indoors  photos have a yellow look and are just terrible  the camera does seem to do a really good job on outdoors shots  this is the first iphone i have had so it may be the camera in the renewed phone is just subpar and not indicative of all iphones pros   memory  touchscreen sensitivity  fingerprint sensor  included applications  screen visibility  appearance  ease of use  wireless charging compatible and price cons   camera is awful  my    alcatel took better indoor photos overall  camera notwithstanding  i would recommend this phone to anyone  a coworker just bought the same phone new  with half the memory and paid    more than amazon s renewed price ,5
159,i brought iphone   unlocked for my   yr old daughter she loves it and don’t forget a case  there was no problems at all setting it up and using it  i brought it for christmas gift for her  so far so good thanks ,5
160,bought three for my kids and everything works accordingly doesn t come with an actual apple charger but that s ok the charger that came with it worked fine just would recommend buying an actual apple charger so you don t burn out your system,5
161,the phone arrived ahead of schedule   the physical appearance was exceptional and most of the basic functions work excellently   the problem i ve found in the month that i have had the iphone are that it will not connect to my wireless printer on my home network   so i can t print from the phone and when doing web searches  the battery drains in minutes  so using it for navigation is out of the question   luckily  i have a navigation system in my vehicle ,3
162,my grandchild is very happy with this phone   battery last a long time  and that makes my grandson happy  and i m happy when he s happy ,5
163,phone is true to form  a few disappointing things to note  camera does not fully work  if i want to take a selfie  yes  but if i want to take a pic of something i’m looking at  it’s completely black screen  my touchid feature does not work for passwords as i’ve went through all my preferences to ensure all is marked correctly and i still have to manually go into my passwords  which my touchid works to access that  but not when logging in to frequented sites  overall  not jazzed about my purchase  probably would have had better luck purchasing at a local cell phone store ,2
164,like everything about this phoneall that i need in a phonethe price was right,5
165,i bought this phone to replace my old iphone    because the battery wasn t keeping a charge all day  any longer   when i got it home  i thought that my wife  who also has a     might want to try it out first  since hers was having the same issue  but after thinking about it for a few days  she told me to try it out first   well  first i had to find a youtube video to figure out how to change the sim card  since i hadn t done it in many years   then  after carefully replacing the sim card  i go to turn on the new used phone  and    nothing   i had charged it beforehand  so i knew the battery wasn t dead  but the home button didn t work   the return process is pretty simple  but it s just a drag to get something new used  only to have to send it back and get it replaced   i ll update this review after the replacement arrives       update  the replacement arrived a week ago and voila     this one works    so far  so good   it seems the home button on the iphone   has a different  feel  than the iphone    which has a more positive  click  to it   battery life is ok  but doesn t seem to be quite as good as a brand  new phone  everything else seems to work ok  so my wife wanted to upgrade her   to one of these  since her battery wasn t lasting either   we just got hers   transferred the simm card  so we ll see how that one does ,3
166,phone came in new condition and works well  the only downside was the screen scratched very easily  idk if it was replced with an aftermarket or something but overall a good buy ,4
167,this was exactly the replacement phone my elderly father needed  he had a   that could no longer get updates and he needed a home button  it came like new ,5
168,phone looks and works great  no issues at all ,5
169,a everyday phone,3
170,the battery life on this phone is excellent infact so far everything about this phone has been excellent  ,5
171,i bought three and all are almost spotless and almost look new  honestly  they look so good that i wonder even if they were pre owned  they all have an okay battery with the   iphone   having     the second had    and the fourth had    so nothing too crazy  but as promised  they are all    or higher  which i am content with  my only and biggest complaint so far is that one of the iphones has an ever so slight pressure mark and the screen  the pressure mark is very small and unnoticeable  but i d still prefer that it wasn t there at all apart from that  it is all good  i still recommend it regards hudson,4
172,i m still within my   days but i haven t had any problems so far hopefully it s not one of those phones that break down when the warranty goes out so far i haven t had any problems within   daysi wasn t able to just put the chip in the phone and it start up like the instructions said i did not buy a brand new sims card i use my previous one that was compatiblebasically that was what the instructions indicate you do for you to activate the phone at home immediately without taking it to your phone carrier but i was able to take it to my phone carrier to activate without any issues ,5
173,i had my iphone   go out  i was trying to get something similar in size  i wasn t big on getting the newest and most to date phone because its really expensive   i purchase a apple   from here  it came no scratches  beautiful screen  i would had been super happy  but i could not get t mobile to service the phone  i think it was t mobile being lazy  i had to send this phone back and wait for a refund  the seller was helpful in every way  understood my issue why i had to return it  issued me a full return with no hassle  thank you  for tying to help     as promised ,5
174,overall phone was at    as they expected it sooner the screen is lifting around the home button to the seller  if you were going to put screens on your phones  make sure to secure the home button and do a decent job bio beware,3
175,bought two of them for my siblings and they both came in amazing condition  i was skeptical because of the price but i would definitely recommend and buy again  even came with screen protectors ,5
176,at the time i bought this  i almost lost trust in  renewed  products on amazon since i was sold an iphone   that developed many issues past its return date  and when it became unusable  i had to buy this phone    year later this phone is the exact same as it was when it first came on my doorstep  battery still holds up  and no issues at all  this phone saved me from a shaky camera  not being able to use headphones  not being able to use wi fi or even make calls at some point  this phone really met my expectations  and it did so very well ,5
177,bought this iphone   in supposed excellent condition  battery life is supposed to be over    but battery health setting says  your battery s health is significantly degraded   and  maximum capacity      the phone also got quite hot when i plugged it in  i don t think this qualifies as  fully functional  excellent condition  battery life at least     the phone looks nice  i received it   days ago and am trying to figure out what to do  my iphone   still has    battery life on a   battery  and works fine but won t run up to date software for the app i need  needless to say this is frustrating and time consuming   product support  on my amazon order sent me to apple  but this is not their problem  if i undo everything  return it  and try for another  i am taking the same risk or even other risks ,3
178,                    the media could not be loaded                  great camera and mic battery life is okay   but everything else is going well only problem i can think of is i order space gray and got black but thats fine because i wanted black in the first place but space gray was the cheapest over all great price and product ,5
179,have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great   it is an iphone      model   it looks brand new and everything functions as it should   a note to straight talk users   that is my carrier and when i put my straight talk sim card in this phone it works great but i went to the straight talk website and logged in so i could transfer my new phone and register it   the website kept giving me an error when i entered the phone s imei or serial number so i called straight talk support after working with me for a while  the rep said  you can t use your current sim card because you have an unlocked phone   you are going to have to buy a new sim card and then register that and the new phone with our  bring your own phone  system on the website    i asked if i did that could i keep my phone number and he said yes   i did some research online and got the impression the the bring your own phone is not for existing customers  but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers   not sure about that  but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is  i am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new sim and trying to register it with straight talk   i think they don t want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the straight talk website or an authorized supplier so i am leaving well enough alone   the phone works fine with my sim card  the only thing is that on the straight talk website it shows i have a samsung galaxy instead of an iphone     no harm  no foul ,5
180,iphone was delivered on time in nice packaging  was very surprised and happy to find they put in a brand new battery as the first thing i did was check the battery health and it was    healthy  installed a few apps and went thru the setup and didn’t have any issues ,5
181,i bought this for my   year old nephew   he was so excited   it was a good purchase  looked new,5
182,                    the media could not be loaded                  i do like writing reviews especially for used phones because it helps everyone  a special shout out to the synergy phone renewal program team  my iphone   came in perfect condition with the battery capacity of         really  when i ordered this phone last week i was having second thoughts about needing an iphone just for work as i already have a iphone   but didn t want to use it for both personal and work so i took a chance and went with the    i was going to get a   but the   is only    more  i kind of hoped it would have some scuffs and that the battery was at   something percent capacity  so i could send it back and just use my   mini but i don t want the wear and tear on that battery alone as the   mini already has a small battery  i told myself the phone would need to be perfect and i would keep it  well perfect it was  i have ordered a samsung galaxy    and it had screen burn in as well as a galaxy   plus that had a swollen battery  not from synergy  so used phones can be hit or miss but this iphone is brand new just in a different generic box but it came with the official iphone cable and charging brick  all for        tax  so yes i am keeping this for work and am as happy as i will ever be from a used phone  thank you synergy  you all rock ,5
183,looked brand new…purchased the end of november for a christmas present and now the charger has stopped working…it’s only a little over a month it been in use,3
184,the battery life is really bad has to stay on the charger,3
185,                    the media could not be loaded                  just got the phone in the mail today and upon opening the package i saw     the phone  bubble wrapped well      the charger and box and    some papers talking about warranty and such  i noticed there was no sim card ejector like the product description stated  the battery health was     upon touching the phone i realized the screen was popping out as if it had a screen protector  because of that the phone case i had bought does not fit properly along the volume and power buttons on the side  you can see in the video how thick the screen is compared to the rest of the phone  did anyone else get a phone with a screen protector  or is that a replacement screen of some sort  i’m tempted to try peeling it off but don’t want to let my impulses get the best of me…,3
186,dice como nuevo pero tiene una mancha blanca en la pantalla,3
187,this phone arrived in pristine condition  like new  the setup took about an hour because the phone required ios     to be installed before any data transfer was allowed  the directions off the internet are very straight forward  i sat my old phone next to this one and turned on blue tooth and the rest is history  through blue tooth the phones do all the communicating  the only thing i needed was my apple id to log through the transfer and my entry phone from my old phone   the company that provided this phone literally had thousands of reviews and most favored   stars or better  although the phone has only been with my one week  i am very pleased  i went through     s to get this one  the quantity of reviews and the quality of reviews really sold me  another plus is the company included their phone support number and a scanner code if i ran into trouble  which the other three companies did not supply i added an otter symmetry case and a glass protector and overall am pleased this is not a honeymoon feeling with the product  just very happy with the product in and of itself ,4
188,i wasn t too confident when purchasing but took a chance and this phone is great  worth it  great condition  works perfectly  i highly recommend,5
189,this is my third week with this phone  its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems  first of all what i hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which i tried everything i possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked  then after some researched i learnt that all iphones from japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent  last thing is the battery life  it came with    capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some youtube videos i think its just how iphone   are because of all these running apps and stuff so i did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot  so i don’t know if that’s how the iphone   are  and also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll  mine came a with   scratches very neat with the charger  not original but its still very good  all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a   day or i think three months free return  and also i wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so i currently use   wireless which is bum a    hope this review helped its  percent honest edit  you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as microsoft pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds  other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone ,4
190,i purchased this amazon renewed iphone   to replace the one i lost over the weekend   it was delivered one day sooner than expected  in a box containing a wall charger  didn t expect that    there appear to be no scratches on either front or back  and the battery health shows      it activated on the verizon network with my new sim card without any problem   i ve only had it one day  but it s much nicer than i was expecting   honestly  it looks brand new ,5
191,i bought two phones   both are fine and in good condition  however the battery life on both is totally shot so now i have to go to the apple store and get new batteries   they charge overnight to    and within minutes of use  they are down to      the batteries really should be replaced before reselling ,3
192,i decided to buy a phone for christmas  it’s in very good condition for what quality i bought  the battery life is pretty good but back touch doesn’t work ,5
193,it’s has allot of issues color doesn’t stay charge for long at all  iam new to apple phones but not sure i would buy another,3
194,i always get iphone products because they are never a letdown  this phone is good quality and holds a charge for about   days with a little less than  average daily use  the screen is smaller than i like but the clarity and resolution is perfect even for watching a movie  one problem i have is the on off ringer swith  it s a turn style nob instead of a push button  its a little hard to grip and turn   so no wonder they ditched this nov in the later models  even they knew it was a fail,5
195,the battery was weak   grains faster  i would like to change the iphone  ,4
196,i have a love hate relationship with apple  i will not buy a new product from them ever  why  they brick phones with updates  that s shady  they smile while they do it too  so  well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones  prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn t affect my choice of where my cash goes  what does have some weight in my decision making is customer service  i pay the asking price i get a device as advertised  simple enough right  you would be surprised or maybe you wouldn t  the local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don t seem to get what good customer service is  so     okay  get to the point right  i got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and i didn t have to deal with anyone so that s a plus  however  the appearance of the item was ummm      acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector  the peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and i m sure feeling slightly used have i mentioned it prior to this post  nope  it really wouldn t matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn t as expected  customer service guys  don t just don t  will i buy another when the time comes  yup  whatta ya do  smile and count your blessings these days i guess  it could always be worse ,3
197,thank you for the two iphone  ’s they look brand new and operate great  no issues  no scratches  and we are completely satisfied ,5
198,i was gonna order off blacklist or the other used iphone websites because this had a lot of   star reviews  but most look to be damaged from shipping or got a  defective product    which they can fix with the packaging   i recently broke my xr  and ordered this one for a replacement and nostalgia reasons  the space gray seller kanga  and to get one with    battery health is a nice surprise  so i don’t have to do it myself anytime soon it has some wear scratches that are barley visible but i don’t care considering it’s a   year old used phone back and front glass is in prestigious condition and not some cheap knockoff bs and the camera   touch id both work flawlessly for    shipped  i’m impressed beyond expectations other than the packaging had me worried for a bit  i’m aware that conditions may vary  but if you need a quick phone or want to switch back to the good ol days with the home button this is a great option  i will update if i have any problems up until my warranty expires pros fast shipping and a pristine unlocked phone for     plus a warranty  so you have plenty of time to test the phone cons  packaging is sketchy as hell,5
199,for those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews  i ordered my from electro wireless  the phone took about a week to ship out  but to be fair i ordered just before the fourth of july and i can see how that would gum up the works  it arrived within a day of being shipped though  so that made up for it the phone looks immaculate  no scratches or dents   so far i ve had no issues  though it s only been   hours   i booted it up  put in my sim  placed calls  sent texts  changed display settings  tested the speakers with my music  etc    anything i could really think to test i did  the phone came with the tool to open the sim tray  a usb plug  and charge cable  the plug and cable are not apple products  which i expected  but since some reviews act surprised  i ll confirm for those of you who think that really matters  there are two minor downsides  the battery capacity is only at    right now  while that s still entirely useable  at    the battery is essentially dead needs replaced  so i ve only got    to use  though i m not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn t matter  the second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector  but  it s unfortunately the wrong size  not sure if it s for the   or a newer iphone  but it sure isn t for the regular old    i ordered a case anyway  so it s not really an issue for me ,4
200,unfortunately  this refurbished worked like most people expect a refurbished phone to work namely  it would freeze  and apps would randomly shut down despite ios being current and the apps not needing updates  also got very hot during charge i tolerated it because i needed it then the microphone died rendering phone calls useless   no one could hear you then the charge port i mean  if i wanted to pay for parts and fix it myself i could have saved    of the price and done it with my old phone   especially since these barely make it through the warranty before giving up the ghost it was definitely a mistake i won’t make again  and recommend you don’t  unless you don’t mind spending    for a one month phone ,3
201,the phone has glitches and moves down  never again ,3
202,sometimes weaker connection sometimes weaker connection to wifi than my old iphone    which i had to replace because the microphone had died  the screen is hyper sensitive to touch so unintended opening of links are often  but all is all it’s good value for the price  to wifi than my old iphone    which i had to replace because the microphone had died  the screen is hyper sensitive to touch so unintended opening of links are often  but all is all it’s good value,4
203,came in perfect condition if you gone want to screen mirror with this phone go ahead and get the apple lightning adapter makes it so much easier than downloading payable apps peace ,5
204,i purchased two of the iphone  ’s as christmas presents  had some issues with one however they were super quick to respond to my email to help fix the problem     recommend ,5
205,i ve been an iphone user for the past   years  and while i love the interface and design  i do not like paying the high price for a new phone  last month  after dropping my iphone    i know i m very behind on the models  but it still worked well    i made the decision to upgrade  i love that i can use amazon renewed to find a iphone at a fraction of the price of a new one many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems  since the seller hybrid it had great reviews  i felt better about taking the risk   to be noted  i initially bought a iphone   from hybrid it  but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iphone    the return was easy and the seller was helpful  the phone i received was in great condition  and i had no trouble setting it up with my at t sim card  i ve been using it for the last three weeks  and i haven t run into any issues there are a few things to add  the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug in  it did not come with headphones  so if you are buying an iphone    you ll have to buy bluetooth headphones or earpods with the lightning connector  which are about    on the apple site  finally  the battery health is at    according to my phone  which is expected with a refurbished phone  it does last me through the day  but something to note if you are in the market  i hope this helps ,5
206,i got the   iphone   used and refurbished  it s unlocked  and my  att  sim card had no issues with the phone  all iphone   s should have the capacity to take the various sim cards  so i wasn t too worried  the battery capacity is at     which the seller advertised would be above    so they are true on their word  the phone looks good  it s clearly used  and the charger cable may not be genuine apple and the plug is definitely not an apple product  that s all in their description as well and i don t mind that at all overall i m very please with the phone  it has only been a week  so it may be too early to tell  i will update if the satisfaction changes since some reviews report phones going dead within   months  honestly if this phone holds  for    it s a great deal and i ll definitely buy again update  the previous review stays  however i am sending the phone back and deducting a star because i do not believe it was unlocked  the reason i purchased the phone in part because my previous phone broke but also because i knew i was changing cellphone services  i had to purchase another phone because i was told they couldn’t the one i purchased ,4
207,i specifically sought this us based model number    it is listed as such   awesome   i instead received a japanese version model    apple p n   a    did you know that the japanese model doesn t allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures  or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording   after some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys  i researched the model number and learned why it was happening   i ended up downloading a non apple camera app  in order to avoid the sound effects   if i was sent the   model as listed  this issue would not have cropped up   that is why i am taking off one star from this review to the seller s credit  the phone arrived a day early  was packaged well  and was in excellent physical shape   all i had to do was put my sim card in it  and load in everything from my itunes account   i ve had it for several weeks  with no hiccups applecare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as     but this is obviously a used phone   still a good value for me ,4
208,i was skeptical at first about buying another used phone as me previous used phone was decent but  was a little rough around the edges  when i decide it was time for an upgrade i knew i wasn’t gonna be going for the newest iphone because i wanted something cost effective and i don’t really care about having the newest one when they come out  being this was a different sell i figured i would give it a shot  and the only complaint i have was the color wasn’t what i was expecting it almost looks like rose gold  like pink essentially  but i’ve grown to like it  and it would disconnect from my phone carrier sometimes and say no service  but it hasn’t done that in a while so i’m extremely happy to say i think for the condition  gb size and battery life  this was a good purchase  the phone performs very well in various aspects  camera takes good pictures  visual quality of the screen is great for watching videos or playing games  and the battery life can last an entire   hour shift at work with battery to spare  of course that make be using it sparingly but i believe     hours is about how long you could use it continuously  depending on the app and things like that  once again great purchase ,5
209,so far  everything seems to be in perfect condition  no complaints  wish i had gotten a splitter for my headphones  but that’s not on them to provide such accessories  the phone is in perfect working order  thank you for quality service ,4
210,do your homework   when you get the phone  check the serial number  several sites online  to make sure it is not blacklisted   anytime you buy a renewed or used phone  you should do that  do that before you insert the sim card and try to use the phone had some minor issues  at first    cleaning with spray air  cotton swabs and alcohol took care of all of them had to clean the lightening port  to get it to charge the sound was not very loud   cleaned the ear piece slit at the top of the face  and the speaker holes at the bottom   shockingly  that fixed all the sound issues   then it was loud   had to turn the sound down  after    even well worth the purchase and the value   be patient  work through the small issues  and it will pay off   would purchase one again      stars instead of   for the small issues   very happy  though ,4
211,the phone works good and is like brand new except for it’s hard to hear when i get a text because the volume is low,4
212,good,5
213,when i first opened the box i noticed that the screen glass was raised about     of an inch or more above the surface of the phone  unlike the original iphone   which is flush   feeling that was an unacceptable defect i requested a return   however  the phone itself was in pristine condition and appeared to function properly so i decided to keep it and try it   the otter case i have actually fit perfectly with the raised face plate glass so that was eliminated as any issue of concern   in fact i think the thicker glass might even provide more protection i activated the phone and it has worked perfectly for the past week   much faster and better battery life than my existing iphone     it appears this company delivered on its promise of a quality refurbish   i will update this review if i experience any problems as the phone get more use ,4
214,i read the reviews after i purchased and instantly got nervous  my daughter had her phone stolen from her so i was somewhat in a rush to replace it for her  and a refurbished iphone   for under    seemed like a pretty good gig  first  i got the phone   days sooner than expected which was nice because i was able to set it up and make sure all was well before she was even expecting it  when first looking at the phone  it was in great condition  the charger we were provided wasn’t manufactured by apple but it definitely does the job  my fear was going to be that the phone wasn’t truly “unlocked” as some reviews state  but it was a relief when the phone company told me there was no problem at all and quickly set it up for me  her phone was up and running almost as soon as it arrived on our doorstep  after stopping by the store for a new sim card which wasn’t provided  no problem for us though  it only ran us about      overall i’m thankful we purchased this phone because it saved me a lot of money and works just fine for my daughter  it was exactly as i expected it ,5
215,the iphone   was in prefect condition with not a scratch to be found anywhere   it had the exact memory as advertised   i could not be happier with it t mobile on the other hand was terrible   the first store told me that the phone was not compatible and that i should go get another one   even though it displayed t mobile when it was turned on it wasn t compatible   really the next store took a really long time to add a sim card and the customer service support for the stores is as bad as the ones we get when we call   one guy  accidentally  hung up on us after half an hour after it was clear that he didn t know what he was doing   the next person got the phone going but assigned the sim to my existing phone   now we had two phones that didn t work   the next rep couldn t believe that we didn t do this on purpose but was able to get them both going so the phone is great t mobile is not ,5
216,le doy   estrellas porque la batería se descarga fácilmente aunque la ponga en ahorrar batería segundo cuando hablo por   minutos se sobrecalienta ya lo demás muy bien ,4
217,first iphone for me in twenty years  high resolution camera  video and quick overall performance ,5
218,my first iphone  so i will be learning for awhile ,5
219,i ve never owned a iphone before  so i decided to go the refurbished route due to this  and i m significantly impressed  this tiny guy was a hassle to get used to screen size wise initially but after a week or so  it was easy also being refurbished there were a few things to note    this unit originally was a sprint cdma model  with a qualcomm radio inside    it was fully unlocked however  works with both mint mobile and    if it matters  benchmarking speed tests oddly made this unit max out at   no matter how many times i tried and    battery capacity for me was     and this unit holds about   hours of charge with low power mode enabled     battery with   charge cycles translation   a   battery  with a   screen  grants you   hours of screen on time  somehow   just don t play games with this  it ll kill the battery quickly    probably not that important  but the display  camera and touch id sensor were all replaced which probably meant whomever had this device originally probably shattered the screen so all in all its hard to get used to  i m so used to needing a   battery in my old phone to give me the same all day battery life  yet this one with under   gives me     of battery life easy oh and i would go and buy the apple smart battery accessory as well  it increases your battery capacity to   total  and this phone usually lasts about   days on a single charge  its nuts  would buy again ,5
220,purchased in april    the battery started wearing out after a year  december     now the battery is fried and i will be seeking to purchase a new battery tomorrow ,3
221,this iphone   was great value for money  i do not use it as my primary cell phone  but as a house phone  the quality is great  the battery life is only     so just over the    mark  this is not too much of an issue for me  as the phone stays on the wireless charger all the time  there is also a screen placed over the front of the phone  which is great  but as a result  the home button is not flush with the rest of the iphone  with feels a little wired and takes some getting used to  otherwise  good value for the money ,4
222,there are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn t work on verizon  broke shortly after  etc   it certainly made me pause before purchasing  but i really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn t going to pay top dollar for a new phone again i ordered the phone on a tuesday  and was surprised when the fedex box showed up on thursday  a full   days earlier than estimated    next  the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable   finally  the phone looked absolutely brand new   not a touch or smudge anywhere   i immediately took it to the verizon store  and they got it registered on the network within   minutes i know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine  but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn t work   it would seem like it s a good company though and perhaps they d swap it out if you happen to be unlucky  i can imagine it has to occasionally happen   it is a used phone after all  each with a different history    apparently i got one from a grandma that didn t take it out of the box    overall  very happy   hopefully you will be just as fortunate   and if not  i d feel safe about working with them company to make it right ,5
223,i almost never write reviews  i think it s worth doing so here   many of them here scared me   but  given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold  i took the plunge and bought the product   i waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here   it arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left hand corner that i really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place   within   hours  i made a larger blemish to the poor   when i dropped it screen side down on my hard floors in my apartment  luckily  the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn t affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party   i guess  so the disaster mostly was avoided   this experience made me come to terms with the fact that it s only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode   pro tip  i highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don t end up like me the iphone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator  who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision   in all seriousness  i am thrilled with this purchase  apple designed them to be slippery   see that you buy a screen protector ,5
224,phone was in great condition  my son loves it,5
225,when i bought this used refurbished phone  i was just happy to get an  upgrade  from my ancient iphone    what i needed was something secondhand  affordable and still usable i was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new—even pristine  as promised by seller in terms of functionality  the sensors and controls feel as though i ve bought a new phone  all   was available  the speakers  microphone and display work very well when i was switching out the sim card from my old iphone    the iphone   started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer  without my activating the migration function   very cool  the transfer was so near perfect that the iphone   migrated all my whatsapp messages  which i was expecting to lose  because i don t use icloud   the migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms  i needed to type in the initial passwords again  even though they were transferred to and saved on the iphone      just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time by the way  i am a singapore buyer  and this order was routed through an oregon transshipment facility  before it was shipped to singapore what s the takeaway i can offer in this review  buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw  there is a chance you may get a dud  in this order  i am happy to say that i got exactly what the seller promised  so here s my   star thumbs up ,5
226,pristine condition cosmetically but  fingerprint reader only works a third of my attempts  the battery life is limited to about a half day  and i’m not a heavy user  just calls  text  and checking email   i don’t watch videos  so the battery is sad  the listing stated battery health guarantees at least    and that is exactly what my phone indicated  so  i will have to get a new battery installed immediately to make my “new” phone useable  so  now i’m over    after the    battery replacement cost  time will tell  the seller gives   days return exchange but i fear if i exchange it the replacement will be worse  and cosmetically this one is without a flaw ,4
227,the phone looks nice and works well i’m very pleased ,5
228,this phone was supposed to have    or more battery life   it only has    battery life   i used siri gps to go   miles away and it drained the battery from           if you want more life you should get a different phone  it won t last as long   read all reviews from this product starting at   stars and then buy from someone else   these are con men and they will rip you off ,5
229,i was skeptical whether it will works  i received as it was advertised and it’s working well ,5
230,only had a week but so far working grest,5
231,i just like the phone,5
232,this was the first time i ordered from a batch advertisement   you take a risk right   the notes said scratches may be on screen but are not visable when screen is on   well i must have been the exception because i could still see them   there were two pretty deep knicks   i m not into paying money for something of this quality   i ve had better luck buying from individual owners that post the exact details   good luck   its russian roulette ,3
233,my moms christmas present and she can text on it but not call she can not hear on it curious can it be exchanged,3
234,great value for the cost,5
235,seller for my order was refoned   i have to say  at least so far i m very pleased   the phone shipped quickly and arrived a day early   case and screen both appear new   no scratches  dents  etc   battery charged up to    no problem   i ordered the unlocked version  i popped in the sim card from my fried iphone se and had no issues connecting to verizon   given what  cr apple is charging for a new iphone  buying refurbished is the way to go ,5
236,i had an issue with the first phone  and they immediately responded and swapped it out the phone works great  it looks almost new  and i recommend this product and company ,5
237,i thought i was buying a refurbished phone with new battery or one that would hold a charge   but  it did not hold a charge   went from     according to a technician was     to   in matter of hours   i just had to pay     for a new battery   i would appreciate a partial refund ,2
238,edit  this phone is good  i pulled my new screen protector off of it and everything works really well  maybe if you want a screen protector  you will need to use a thinner one than ailun     older  i might change this review if i can do something to change this  this is really annoying when typing  space  period  and   work when they feel like working   which is about half of the time  i simply hate it tapping     many times just for it to work  if i can t fix this  i am definitely returning it ,5
239,i actually accidentally ordered this product when i meant to only add it to a wish list  i contacted the seller and they agreed to work with me to return it  but i decided to actually keep it  but kudos to the seller for being great  the phone was in perfect condition  it came on a recent but not the newest version of ios so i had to update it before using it  no dents or scratches anywhere  battery health was at    when i checked it too  it does not come in original packaging or with apple cables to charge it or to connect     audio cables  it does come with a mfi  made for iphone  ac power brick and lightning connector cable and a sim eject tool to help you change sim cards i just want to share some insight about gsm vs cdma models  this is a gsm model phone  however i am a verizon customer   which is a cdma network  gsm model iphones have all the lte bands that verizon uses  i think verizon s main  lte band is   or   if you want to look up compatibility  yourself   so even with a verizon sim card in this gsm only phone  i can still access all of verizons   networks and have phone and text service  as well as lte and voice over lte  if i ever go out in the middle of nowhere i won t be able to make calls likely because i won t have access to verizon s cdma bands  but it s just as good as any cdma model for most peoples uses  just don t expect to have cell service while camping or in some state  national parks if you are a verizon customer    and lte is rolled out very wide so you shouldn t have any issues ,5
240,this is the second device we ve gotten from the seller  and aside from making the process harder than any other return we ve had with other products this device is having the same exact issue as the first one purchased replaced  we are in the process of checking the imei and serial to make sure they just didn t send us the same device back to us  essentially  the port that is used for charging headphone usage with a lightning port does not work  it will charge the device but will not allow for clean usage of any headphone  rated by apple or not  nor any adapters   the person on the other end states there is running water sounds  white noise  in the background  after extensive testing and troubleshooting this could not be fixed on our end  so we returned the device and asked for a working replacement  although  the replacement sent has the exact issue  we are not satisfied  my gf likes this particular model of the iphone and it was a gift to her  but this is turning out to be a bad experience with this seller the thing that is even worse is that the process for returning is tedious  we had to send the phone to them first before they would ship the replacement  which means we had to rely on the icloud for the back up to get her info from one device to the other  and she would be without a phone for several days  which is dangerous for her as she has to travel long distances on occasion alone this was not a good experience and the device is still not meeting expectations  if i could give a   i would,1
241,the phone was good but the back camera came broken it’s a good phone overall but like you gotta be lucky to get a good one,3
242,was definitely questioning this buying option  a refurbished phone from amazon  huh  definitely don’t regret it though   my ‘new’ phone is amazing without a single issue   have had it for   months and works exactly for a very good price  i’ve been recommending this amazon program to everyone,5
243,the battery life is great and so is the fingerprint reader  i’m very happy with it ,5
244,      bought this phone in august  arrived in original packaging with an apple charger  worked great with no problems  like new  camera worked great  absolutely no issues  however  my phone got stolen from me at the end of october  so i ordered a second one  complete opposite experience  came in a small  dirty box with some weird charger  had obvious scratches on the screen  and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality  i had been waiting for   weeks to replace my phone so i gave it a shot anyway    the microphone did not work at all  when people called  i could hear them and they couldn t hear me  which i had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from aaa  who hung up on me upon my  lack  of response when i answered the phone  took it to t mobile and chatted online with apple to do some troubleshooting  turns out it s just a bad refurbished phone  so the only answer was to return it  disappointed overall  good luck with your order         my review from   stars to   stars  still leaving off one star for the   busted up phone  and   star for the inconvenience and   weeks of waiting to replace my phone  as well as both times the shipping delayed   however only by   day each time  but i think i should mention it since it is listed  prime free delivery    i ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone  thank goodness it paid off  i got another phone  quality as good as the first one  i leave this review after     weeks of phone   with no issues  i will update my review if anything changes but currently i am relieved it worked out ,3
245,very good,5
246,the girls liked the new phones ,5
247,everything works fine no cracks the only problem i have is that the battery health was on   and i understand it was renewed but they couldve swapped put the battery but i definitely recommend this phone ,4
248,i needed an older iphone as my     samsung z    smart phone is not compatible yet with the dexcom medical app that i will be using soon  i plan to use this iphone   specifically for that app s functions only   no phone text email services needed  the only requirements are that the iphone can connect to wifi  no sim cards carriers needed   can be upgraded to the latest ios software  it can  and that i can download the app itself  which it can also   and it has bluetooth  to connect with the device sensor  it does   so  everything is good to go for my personal use of this iphone until my samsung z   is added to the device s compatibility list ,5
249,i do not want to be negative about this iphone     when received it looked like  new  condition   i was pleased with that   day    generic charger  included  did not work   even i was ok with that   i had another from an iphone   it worked fine so that is how i know the included charger ws defective   i was impressed with the packaging   it was so nice   neat   i charged battery to    and  wow  could not believe rapid it discharged  about   hours    i figured i had too many apps running in the background   that didn t solve the issue   few features i set my preferences did not retain   after powered off and then on  my preferences were not saved   i do feel the phone is a value for the price and it does what it is intended to   make   receive calls   bluetooth signal is great   i was trying to be  thrifty  but will just purchase a new iphone  w apple care coverage  and pay it in   months   i will be returning this phone   again  for a younger  maybe school aged child it is a great phone   the messaging text is fine and i was able to receive a small photo attachment   if i had a child  this would be the phone they get  from me  before i would buy them a      phone   so my review is   stars and my main concern is the battery life ,3
250,pretty good so far  got here earlier the  expected  battery life at     getting the newest     update took a little but it’s an older phone so i didn’t mind it  it was for my father and he’s happy  aswell as i  great condition no scratches  doesn’t get better than this  definitely recommending to friends if anyone needs a new phone,5
251,i got this phone for my daughter as she is starting to catch the bus on her own and i want to keep the communication and track her for safety  this was great for her  good price and so far works great  we live in bermuda so i was worried it would not be unlocked  sometime they say unlocked but then you get it and its not  but this one was unlocked  so i was very happy about that too ,5
252,the phone is in excellent condition  very light wear on the surface if you look hard  but normally indiscernible  battery is stable  charges and maintains power well   overall  very impressive and satisfied ,5
253,fantástico ,5
254,it s an iphone,5
255,siempre si lo use  gracias,5
256,i bought this for my son   the phone looks like new but the battery max health is only      this is generally the threshold to replace the battery or suffer performance issues   i rolled the dice on ordering this since i purchased one for my other son a few months back and it was    ,3
257,not everyone needs a brand new iphone  you know why  cause it’s an iphone and they last  it’s reliability backed up by amazon’s refurbished program  just sweetens the deal  now  after   years by tween is still excited about her phone ,5
258,had issues with the battery and missing try and i am satisfied with how the seller handled it  although i was upset because i was dependent on the phone  after they received the first phone back  i received my new on within two days as promised  the new phone works perfect  ,4
259,i bought this iphone in march of    i had always been an iphone user before  but decided to try a google pixel… i hated the android phone  i didn’t want to break the bank on a brand new phone which at the time was the iphone    i purchased the   because it was very reasonably priced  and i just wanted an iphone again badly  i didn’t know what to expect from a refurbished phone  but i’m very impressed  the phone works just like you were to buy it at a retail store  camera  fingerprint  apps  phone  and texting all work the way they should  my only complaint would have to be the battery life  but i kinda expected it to be somewhat lower than what the standards are today so i just charge it on my lunch break and i’m good for the rest of the day  i will continue to buy refurbished phones on amazon probably for the rest of my life ,5
260,purchased this for my daughter so she could have a phone for us to contact her while at her extracurricular activities   while it works  the battery did not last and now she needs to carry a portable charger with her phone at all times until i can pay to get it replaced note that before the warranty period expired  and the return window closed on amazon  my daughter informed me her battery was going from    to    in minutes   i checked the battery health in the phone settings and it said that the battery needed to be replaced   i proceeded to place an order for a replacement with the seller under warranty   my replacement order was accepted  but they continued to push out my replacement order on a daily basis for two weeks which pushed it beyond the warranty replacement date   i didn t think anything of it after i stopped receiving reschedule updates to my email   fast forward to the day it was supposed to arrive  it didn t come   i went to find the order and couldn t find it in my orders pending shipment   i then searched the order number that was in the email confirmation  and found out the seller canceled the order without notifying me   in fact  they also wouldn t let me place it again because it was out of the return window   one other note is that when i look at the original order  the return date in amazon was october    and now has changed to september     they actually went in and changed the return window after accepting and canceling the original order   i tried to file a claim with amazon  but it too was no longer valid and denied even though the order was accepted and confirmed  then canceled this is completely unethical and this seller gets away with it   amazon needs to manage it s sellers better ,1
261,i bought this for my sister  because  as g d as my witness  you wouldn t catch me ever using an apple product  i just like myself too much seems to work fine ,4
262,my husband needed a phone and we don t like any of the new iphones  this one was at a great price and works well  had it for a few months now and only a small scratch on the screen but rather then that it s golden,5
263,it works perfectly fine ,5
264,i purchased in good faith an iphone from this seller and gave this phone to my wife for christmas  i transferred all her data over from her old phone  which was then given away  she charged it up  yet  after hours  the charge was drastically dropped  she again charged it to     but after   hours it was reduced to     yet she hardly used it  we took it to verizon and they checked the battery health and saw that “service” was displayed  it also displayed “your battery health is significantly degraded and an apple authorized service provider should replace the battery to restore full performance and capacity”  in other words  the phones battery was no good and couldn’t hold charge my wife got very upset  as being a sr citizen with a medical condition  she relies heavily on her phone  she can not give up her phone and be without one  i had to do something  i called multiple places near me and finally brought the phone to batteries plus  who replaced the battery for    i contacted the seller via e mail and explained the situation  there response was to offer a    credit  i responded that i could not return the phone and that their offer was very unfair  i sent them pictures showing the phones battery health notes and again asking for some help  their response was to say that the phone messages were normal and that everything was good  but they would now offer  me    how sad that there are sellers that rip their customers off and keep on going with no care in the world sam f,1
265,so far i haven t put the phone to use  bit it looks like a good deal,4
266,even tho i had to return i must give high marks to seller   kiss electronics for a incredibly nice refurbished phone  think it was just a problem i was having on my end  read up on it a bit kinda of a common problem but others seemed to fix with updates  my issue was only getting   bar and dropping calls  everywhere i went  i live in houston tx  not lacking cell tower power   at t account for well over    years  ive seen a few phones  tryed updates but couldn t get them to finish  tryed at t my account is probably older then the kids in there and they seemed to have the mindset that it wasnt there phone so not there problem unless i was ready to drop alot of cash  so no problem at all with seller or amazon on this  on home wifi it was perfectly fine phone if i could have gotten some reasonable help from at t probably would have gotten it sorted out,4
267,this phone is great  the speaker came a bit dirty but doesn’t affect sound quality  overall    ,5
268,the phone meets or exceeds our expectations,4
269,good,4
270,great prompt service my iphone gold arrived as described on amazon here  well packaged ready with a screen protector all around the cell phone is in a very good condition everything functional hundred percent copying my previous iphone   to this iphone   was a breeze and only took   minutes i’m super happy with the purchase  i would highly recommend this seller you can tell they respect the customers and sending the item well packed with care and love  on the other hand i order from a different seller here on amazon a black iphone     gb and it was in a horrible condition completely muddy and dirty he was a shame to even open it and try activated by return that the following day  the seller send me a grapevine in a very good price  if you don’t feel like dropping       on a new phone as i have done in my last two iphones i would highly recommend purchasing it from here as i am super happy  and i am very careful when it comes to electronics purchasing online  thank you amazon i appreciate your business and thanks for amazing product ,5
271,i charged the phone and it took an hour to turn on   as i started setting up it seemed fine  so i unplugged it and it suddenly shuts off   try again to check the battery  seriously damaged battery message   i went to a local service and they had to change the battery  it costs     seriously  such a bad testing  amazon  come on… ,3
272,amazing phone  arrived before promise time  excellent condition  responsive seller  unlocked as promised no issues connecting to our carrier metro  the entire experience was very positive  i would highly recommend  the phone is flawless  running perfectly smooth  i ve seen these phones for several hundred dollars more then what we paid  we feel so lucky to have found this seller  i would highly recommend this business to all ,5
273,easy to use,5
274,i almost returned it after i couldn’t get it to read my sim card  but after multiple attempts  a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and i attempted once more to insert my sim card into the phone and it slid right in  where as before it must’ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal  and the compartment that holds the sim card wasn’t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone  but it wasn’t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iphone  and those were both flush with the phone  i’m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved  i ordered the silver case  its white on the back side not silver  but i still like it  with a case on all u can see is the silver apple and i guess the white makes it stand out  otherwise it doesn’t seem like it would  the circle around the home button is silver though  this may be what they consider silver  regardless i’m happy with everything  works and looks like a brand new phone  if i have any issues i’ll update ,4
275,i was afraid when making this purchase because of all the negative comments  however the purchase went well  the purchase was for my eldest daughter  i recommend the hybrid it seller  i loved the cell phone  it is used as new  no noticeable scratches  it is    unlocked  the only bad thing was the capacity of the battery came to me with    health  but i bought him a new battery and i already have a new cell phone  really super recommended  the camera is of good quality  the volume is excellent  the whole cell phone is perfect to be reconditioned  so far i have not had problems  btw im latino so if you want to buy the cell phone for latin america  if it will serve you because it is unlocked   iphone gold   gb  all carriers  seller hybrid it  renewed ,4
276,several scratches around the edges from it being dropped ,3
277,worth every cent  exactly what we need  works like new ,5
278,works great battery life goes down fast,4
279,the phone exceeded my expectations  it was an easy switch over and the phone was in better condition than described   highly recommend this company for your cell phone needs as it relates to usde devices  and i am a very meticulous person when it comes to products  the battery life was at    but that’s what i would expect for an older model phone,5
280,this thing was spotless  looked and worked like new  great beater phone for traveling and you can gift it to someone before you come home and theyll think youre a rock star,5
281,daughter loved it  came in perfect condition  just as described ,5
282,i got the plan   so nothing special but came with some scratches n shi soooo i would recommend but u should probably get a newer phone not the   unless u really want a iphone and are on a budget,4
283,iphone work perfectly  it is just battery get downnso quickly   even in battery health it says its maximum capacity       when i bought it   otherwise device functionally work good ,4
284,i was impressed with the phone   the battery lifespan on the phone when i got it says      not bad at all   no scratches  no dents  looked pretty much new   saved hundreds and now i have the phone i wanted with   to download anything under the sun which is why i replaced my old phone that only had     my work would only allow us to get the   iphone which really annoyed me but i understood why   so i took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone   just pay for it myself   we use at t as a provider at my work  so all i needed to do was take out the sim card from my old iphone and put it in this   beast    i’m so happy i did   so far so good   i recommend this seller for sure  great product  i will update this review down the line if i end up having any problems out of the ordinary   hope this review helps as i was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase   also  i purchased using my amazon credit card which allows you to make   monthly payments around    month at    interest   i can’t lose     that’s the cost of   coffees at starbucks a month   i’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs   okay  i’m done   now i just sound like a bag of hot air ,5
285,i know this might sound weird  but i never thought i would get an iphone  i have been team android since my first smartphone  but necessity made me have to make the switch  so i decided to start safe with this refurbished one my experience has been great so far  mine didn t come with any instructions  but you can pretty much figure out how to get it powered up and ready to go  the phone has lots of security settings and have been easy to maneuver so far so good for me  looking forward to the possibilities ahead ,5
286,with a bit of skepticism we ordered an amazon refurbished iphone   because my wife just loves that model and needed a new one  but what would we actually get   well  it arrived in two days as promised  and we unpacked it to find a phone that essentially looked factory new   not the slightest blemish  we switched sim cards  started it up  initiated the icloud back up  and it is working perfectly in no time at all  we’re very impressed with the amazon renew program ,5
287,overall  i ve been very pleased with this refurbed phone  it was delivered in like new condition and until recently has acted like new  recently  the phone s charging receptacle stopped working without finagling the connector  i have tried   different apple branded charging wires and chargers and it s the same with all    i have to insert and re insert the lightning wire several times  hold it just right  carefully place it at an angle and set a weight on the phone by the connector  only then will it charge  unfortunately  it is out of warranty and i m sure it will be too expensive to fix  so i guess when i can no longer find the sweet spot to charge it  i ll look for another refurbished iphone on a side note  for my daughter  i bought an identical refurbished phone at the same time  different vendor  but i don t think that matters here   and it s working perfectly ,4
288,phone arrived in good condition and given as a gift to grandson grandson was disappointed as charger and cord received was too generic and charging was not too quick  maybe you could send a better charger and cord in order to improve your image to your customers  hope you can do something about it battery is being monitored at this time  hopefully  there will be no issues next month and so on will be posting whatever issues we might have in the coming months thanks for your attention teresa b july       sunday there are other issues found on this iphone    camera flickers and makes noise    someone else s email is showing on the phone    very slow in applications    clicking when trying to use video in view of these issues  the iphone was not properly refurbished and it is very very disappointing the iphone has to be replaced  please let me know how to send it back  if not  just refund the money thanks teresa b ,4
289,no posee reconocimiento facial por el modelo  la vida útil de la batería es del     supongo que por eso el precio del mismo  teléfono desbloqueado,4
290,i purchased a refurbished iphone    there was a major problem with the delivery service from fedex  i was so mad that my inner karen came out    went well above and beyond to fix a problem that wasn t even caused by them   i was pleasantly surprised by their customer service the iphone i bought looks and works like it s brand new  you wouldn t know this phone was refurbished excellent company  excellent service  excellent product ,5
291,the phone arrived promptly  and condition was like brand new   powered up and was able to be up and running with my phone service in no time   battery life so far is really good   very happy with this phone   would definitely buy from this seller again ,5
292,the phone i got had been opened previously  and the battery was completely dead and does not hold a charge  will not power on without being plugged in  just be careful when considering this type of purchase ,2
293,i did have to purchase a new sim card  but overall great purchase for me  a   model for     the battery life is rated at    also  i will add some pictures later showing how great the phone looks ,5
294,battery doesn t last long,5
295,delivery was quick phone looks new works great,5
296,she is happy,4
297,la batería llegó con un    de vida útil y tuvimos que comprar otro cable de corriente pq el que trajo no funcionó    la pantalla está intacta y  reconocimiento fácil funciona a la perfección,4
298,cracked the screen  have replaced screens multiple times  this one wouldn’t take  even bought one with the camera attached so i didn’t have to do all that crap but nope   at this point if you’re seeking a refurbished iphone go with the se   gen or iphone x maybe ,3
299,i ve got to learn the upgrade functions   not sure if the battery is up to oem specs or not   ,4
300,i was able to transfer all my information from my old iphone   to this phone without issue   had so far about   weeks and it is so good so far  if issues arise i will update unless issues start     years down the road   if phone is good for you that period of time then it is time to get another one anyway   apple would have updated their system several times by then and this iphone   will be out of date and system maxed past this phone’s usage  same is about to happen to the iphone     battery was issue i had with old iphone  this iphone has    battery health so far   so so far so good some people just have an unrealistic idea of what they are buying  it is a re manufactured or freshened up iphone  it is not a brand new phone and you are not asked to pay new iphone   price now are you ,5
301,phone works great  had problems with the first one  and seller took care of it  great seller      i would purchase from him again  he was very understanding  and willing to work with me  i hqve never had a third party seller on amazon with such great customer service   would definatly recomend phone from them ,5
302,refurbishment iphone   is like new   most importantly  the battery is well over    as advertised  if something happened to this phone i would definitely order another from here  highly recommended ,5
303,not sure of battery life,4
304,love this phone,5
305,a refurbished locked iphone is no good to me   i ordered an unlocked iphone ,5
306,i ordered this iphone   for my daughter for her birthday and it works great ,5
307,use it for calling   receiving calls use camera mostly,5
308,i bought two phones  a gold and black for my kids the gold came in perfect working order the black one on the other hand looked like the screen wasn’t installed properly and broke within the same day but works properly ,5
309,it was such a nice relief to receive a renewed phone that looked new  packaged as a new device with vinyl covering on front and back and everything to get my son going   the customer support was phenomenal   to be fair  i ran into a small issue with the battery  battery health was    after opening it and using it for   weeks   did we check that status before   no   the seller says it should always be above    and will gladly refund  return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if i visit an authorized apple store   i chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery   seller not only reimbursed the total amount  it was actually more that the receipt i sent  maybe for my time and effort   in any case  totally happy with the purchase  completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller   phone looked perfect and still acts     like new    months later ,5
310,no dents  scratches  scrapes  camera works well  has a slight delay though that may be a software issue  runs fast enough and can handle most apps without cooking your hand  only complaint would be the unreplaced battery  as both phones i ordered came with batteries at      max capacity  but since i have several battery banks  it’s not much of an issue  just be ready to buy a replacement battery kit if you dont have any charging banks on hand ,4
311,the phone is in amazing condition   i love the phone until i went to turn the volume up and it didn t work  it works going down but doesn t work to increase the volume   you have to connect wireless headphones to raise it  but overall the phone was in great shape ,3
312,i m so happy    ,5
313,my son purchased this with his own money  came in excellent condition  no scratches at all  phone works great  i’m about to buy another one from him,5
314,nice gift for nephew  he loves it,5
315,when my daughter s previous  cheap  cell phone screen cracked  i first looked at the cost of repair  and quickly decided it wasn t worth it  we started looking at phones  but i guess peer pressure  she really wanted an iphone  i searched for something that wouldn t break the bank  especially given that hey  that one might get a cracked screen too    and this renewed version fit the financial part perfectly the phone came in a plain box with no belts or whistles  just the phone and the charger  perfectly functional  i paired it with a mint mobile sim card with no problems  the downside   no earbuds  and we all know that apple accessories can be pretty expensive  when my sweetheart lost her charger cable  we resorted to one of my wireless chargers  which works like a charm  i must still have some cables around from the time i had iphones    somewhere   the camera is good enough for her photography class at school  so one more plus there  overall  she is happy  and i think we got a great price   ,5
316,the bad reviews had me worried  but i figured i’d try it anyway  if there was something wrong with it  i can send it back wow    when it arrived the next day  i was really impressed how there were no scratches  cracks  or dings  it looks and runs like it’s brand new def worth     before i got this  i was buying cheap    phones at walmart and after     months  they start getting crappy and i have to replace them  i don’t see me having to replace this phone for a while ,5
317,i liked the phone but it would not charge  i used the cord that came with the phone and it would only charge to     i then used an iphone cord i had and got it to charge to    ,4
318,the last iphone that is flagship with a home button   i love it’s quick fast and in great condition ,5
319,phone works great  battery life great and the phones condition fantastic  i swear it look brand new  great value for the money ,5
320,received sep   life is as expected  fingerprint reader works  phone works  just recently  oct   the loud speakers don t work and sound is blasting from the ear speaker  possible hardware issue  might try to send it in but probably not cause ain t no body got time for that  you get what you pay for ,3
321,love my iphone  the battery life has been excellent  i wait until it gets to    before i recharge it  that comes from the recommendation of my iphone guy  that is so as not to wear your battery out  plus my iphone tells it when i charge it at more than     it is optimal charging and what time it will finish charging  the only thing i don’t like is the icloud  everything backs up to icloud and i would rather back my iphone up to my laptop and then back it up myself  it didn’t take long to fill icloud up  i still give it a   star  cause i can take care of deleting things ,5
322,given as a gift and she was very happy and satisfied ,5
323,christmas present,5
324,phone was fine except for battery,3
325,this is my second  renewed  iphone from amazon  both look and work like a brand new phone  save really big bucks     ,5
326, renewed  iphone   from amazon seller trademore  which is a verizon processing center in ft worth  tx   all renewed phones can be different  but mine arrived in like new condition  doesn t look used at all  battery life was at    which is perfectly fine for a phone that is   years old  the one i received was in mint condition  everything works great  the included charging block is low wattage so i am not using it  but the heavy duty   ft cord they sent works great with my photive   port usb power cord and i am getting  fast charging  with it  i have had it four   days and there are no problems at all  i am impressed at the quality of this phone and would not hesitate to buy from trademore in the future ,5
327,loved this phone a lot it was very nice and let me game on it and have a decent storage only issue i had is that the refurbished one i got had had    battery health so the battery wouldnt last to much other than that i would buy another one any day and you can apparently get a battery replacement kit for like    on amazon it worked very well and was in good condition,3
328,i purchased this phone to use overseas on small trip  while i was on the airport decided to try and use it  put a t mobile sim and it didn t work  worst of all it was sunday and the seller kanga supply wasn t available i arrived at my destination country on sunday   put a local sim card and voilá  it s working later i asked a friend and he told me this happens a lot with us carrier locked phones which at some point get unlocked  they don t work with us sim cards phone is working fine after   days and is in great aesthetic conditions  haven t tried headphones because it didn t come with any accesories besides a generic charger and sim tool i think the seller or amazon should put this warning on the product page ,4
329,this is a better iphone than the   and any before it and at same time it’s not a better phone than   or any that have come since i think the renewed standard has set a high bar  one which was not met with my order  there is a visible scratch on the screen that can be seen at an arms reach  i’m not sending it back to wait phoneless for a new one  but i think it’s a valid complaint  one that is probably common in occurrence but not often acted upon otherwise the screen graphics and interface is really nice  the processor doesn’t leave me wanting  and all these things are known by almost all iphone owners  my review is about renewed  and the difficult standard set that may offer more than what this particular  supplier is able to provide ,4
330,i used to be an apple fanatic and then i switched to google pixel  recently had a bad experience with a refurbished google pixel   phone because i failed to read the buyers reviews  always read them folks especially when buying refurbished phones  and i decided to go back to apple because  why not i didn t want any of the latest models because honestly i don t care for them so i was looking for an iphone   in good quality and with significant storage  i came across this one and i was able to find a   gold iphone   through verizon pre owned  honestly  highly recommend buying from verizon pre owned because not only did it accept my cricket wireless sd card effortlessly but  the phone is literally intact  it basically looks brand new  no scratches  not even on the corners  clean screen and back of the phone  the fingerprinting works perfectly  all of its features work as if it was a brand new phone  plus battery life so far has been doing incredibly well  so if you re thinking about switching over but are skeptical  try looking at verizon pre owned and their reviews and purchase looking forward to continuing taking bomb selfies with this phone ,5
331,good product,3
332,happy with it just as advertised,5
333,mostly good smaller than i expected,4
334,the phone works great and arrived before the expected arrival date   the battery last less than my previous phone  but very satisfied ,5
335,as described and arrived early  battery health  was a little less than would have liked but overall great condition ,5
336,purchased to replace an at t phone that died and was delivered promptly  i placed the sim card in the phone and tried to dial a number  the call was automatically redirected to an   number  the rep answered  at t   and asked for my passcode  i gave it to her  and she began asking questions about my account  something made me suspicious so i hung up and dialed the at t number found on their website  the rep also asked for my passcode  and when i explained what happened  he checked the number and said it was not an at t number  he took my imei and iccid numbers and was able to unlock my phone so i could call out without going automatically to that number  that number could have been totally legit  but i am always careful about situations that don t seem right  no instructions came with the phone to tell me how to get the at t sim card to work  otherwise  the phone works well  and we are satisfied with it ,3
337,earphone  buds do not work  bought extra earphones from amazon  ear phones and buds work fine in other iphones  this one is defective  why do you have to by other accessories so you can charge and listen at the same time    ,2
338,basically a brand new iphone  no scratches or scuffs     battery life when you look in the settings  can’t find an issue yet ,5
339,works great ,5
340,works great,5
341,easy to transfer contact list and else…looks like new…need more time to tell about battery life,5
342,this phone was very glitchy  next time  i will make sure to buy a phone from apple ,3
343,i researched the iphone      and   as replacements for my aging    i also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase  i settled on mywit based on their reviews and their volume of sales  the phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine  if it is a refurb  there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it  not even finger prints or dust  it came with a nice flex lighting cable and apple charger  no sim as advertised  i put the sim card from my old iphone   in it and went through the setup questions  i had a fully functional iphone    in   minutes tops   i selected the iphone   over the   or   due to the advanced technology in the    it is worth the extra    over the same size     it is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge i also purchased a speck candy shell case for this phone  the iphone   has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold  with my dry fingers  it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip  the speck case is a perfect  anti slip and lots of drop and screen protection  see this case here https   www amazon com speck products candyshell phone iphone dp   pleased with the seller too and i would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question ,5
344,purchased an iphone   in “excellent” condition for a christmas gift for my daughter  product listing guarantees functional battery with capacity of at least     not the case at all  phone will not hold a charge  battery depleted within a half hour of light use  the only thing “excellent” about this phone is the physical condition  no scratches  etc   but quite frankly  that means nothing when the phone does not function properly  i never leave reviews on my online purchases  but giving my daughter a christmas gift that barely works is disappointing when you think you are purchasing something that is said to be in “excellent” condition ,2
345,the first problem i have with this iphone  as soon as i get it out of the box it was in  i did what i usually do set the phone up like normal  keep the phone off  eject the sim tray and put the sim card in  i power the phone up and complete the setup process and all that fun stuff  then the phone restarts like normal  then it powers on  and low and behold i can t type on the iphone anymore  then i m thinking the phone is a complete fake or something inside of the phone is malfunctioning  so i ve requested to get a replacement sent to me  i should hear back from the seller in   business days  let me say i ve never had problems with buying phones on here like i have had this one  the other iphone worked perfectly fine but this iphone  there s just a lot of problems with it ,1
346,it s my first iphone  always been into galaxy  i was pretty disappointed with some features overtime  makes me wonder how apple is so rich with these bad decisions they ve done for their phones  android is way superior  i upgraded to the galaxy   ultra and it s amazing  the iphone was okay for the time being  but it only got worse at the last month i had it  i think my iphone   was defective cause over half the time no one could hear me speak on the phone  sometimes better or worse on speaker  i m so glad i m done with this  i m giving it a   out of kindness cause i had some good times with it mainly with music  but even then  putting music on an iphone is stupid too  they re still stuck in   relying on an app to transfer music  itunes  while android is the future  also couldn t edit videos on sony vegas cause that app doesn t support their stupid  mov files  so converting is necessary and i didn t wanna bother  so glad this phone isn t necessary no more  but if i had to say anything good about it  it s okay for the buck and if you like iphones ,3
347,i originally thought this was the   really need to fix you alls descriptions  i shouldn’t be able to type in   n get the  but my daughter loves it ,5
348,was hesitant to upgrade my old se  but i am very glad i did  slightly bigger screen  larger gig capacity and seems to be stronger to connect to wi fi and bluetooth sites  seems to have a faster processor and i like the wireless charging capability ,5
349,at the time of sale the vendor warranted that the battery capacity of this phone would be greater than or equal to     but upon arrival the phone reported that its battery was degraded and in need of replacement  with a current capacity of only    i notified the seller of this defect in its promised performance and requested that it remedy the problem by defraying the cost     plus tax  of a battery replacement by the certified apple technicians at my local bestbuy store  instead the seller gave me the option of returning my phone for a full refund of the purchase price  or keeping the phone and accepting a     courtesy refund   not wanting to find myself once again without the use of a serviceable phone  i elected the second option  despite its obvious inadequacy as a remedy for the seller s breach of its explicit warranty the phone is otherwise fully functional  and its cosmetic condition is good ,2
350,great condition  looks and works like new  i didn t want to buy a new or expensive phone for my   year old so this was just perfect  so far my son is very happy ,5
351,i don t like to buy any kind of device online because you re never too sure about what you re getting  but overall i would highly recommend  only downside is i was at least expecting    battery life  but then that s my fault because i didn t read everything on the sellers page  one of the speakers also isnt working  then after a day of using the device i stumbled upon a problem that was inconvenient  the app store wasn t downloading apps  after being on the phone with apple care for over an hour they couldn t help me with the problem  i ended up factory resetting the phone  it came with a charger and the block  i took my risk and i m not disappointed ,4
352,dislikes    because this was a refurbished unit  the battery life is not that of a new phone    the wi fi hotspot loses connectivity   at times it is better to is the bluetooth connection  which eats more data    i came from android  so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing  this makes the  home screen   which is the only place you can put widgets  useless  i want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone  apple offers very limited widgets  most apps do not have one    there is a glitch in the iphone   that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times likes    not requiring anti virus is nice    siri is worlds better than google assist   waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options  like  siri  read me the content of website xyz   etc    siri is the main reason i switched from android  it is awesome   ,5
353,                    the media could not be loaded                  my first thought when i open the box i thought that maybe some scratches on the phone no there s no scratches no marks or nothing crazy even also my phone company metro she s like i did not know but was renewed it looks brand new that s how crazy this is like i am shocked my first phone ordering on amazon renewed phones i m very shocked i m so happy with the phone also i want to thank amazon this was worth it    all together that s worth it it may be cheaper if you have amazon prime but it s a hundred percent worth money you re not wasting your money at all i m loving my new phone,5
354,right out of the box this phone had no battery life  even after   hours of charging  the screen timed out instantly after every login and when i checked the phone s setting for battery health  i see the battery s health is significantly degraded  this phone is going back  i owned another iphone prior to this  purchased from a different retailer  when you see this message for battery health  you have two options     constant repair replacement of battery or    suck it up and by a new phone ,2
355,product is good except battery life does terrible and that was the whole reason for purchasing a new iphone will probably start using samsung not worth having to charge a phone every   hrs,2
356,you can see the blemish on the screen when its off and when its on  it shows thru any app or picture,3
357,the phone is in great shape and looks brand new  only problem is the battery life is worse than our old phone ,4
358,unfortunately   just after a few short months this phone cannot keep a charge  we will charge it all night and my son will bring it to school and have it sitting in his locker and i’ll be    by noon   not even in use    it also takes at least nine hours to charge to gets to      i contacted the seller we bought new wires you bought new charging ports  apple wires  new blocks and nothing seems to work ,2
359,i ordered this phone on december   and it was expected to come on the    to my surprise it came just two days after on december   without amazon prime  as for the phone itself  it worked well and looked new from afar  i think there were some minor scuffs but nothing a phone case can t hide  the phone itself came with a charger though it wasn t an official apple one  still i appreciate that there was a charger  the only negative thing was that my phone is a japanese phone so when i take photos even with the phone on silent  it still makes a shutter noise  it is an unlocked phone so take it to your provider so they can insert your sim card into it  it is a very simple process  overall a great phone  if you can t afford to buy a new iphone from the store  buy this one instead  i am very happy with my purchase ,5
360,it s first time when i purchased a refurbished iphone and i would do it again  i m    satisfied ,5
361,i need a contact number  my phone is locked and apple needs my serial number  i do not have the box it came in,4
362,bought it for a birthday  christmas gift for daughter,5
363,received product just in time and it s about as cool and crisp as the artic air itself  love it,4
364,the iphone came in pristine condition  no scratches or blemishes visible  clean  impeccable space gray color  phone connected to internet correctly and setup was not an issue  comes with charger  charging block  sim removal tool  and instructions  definitely worth the price more ,5
365,arrived within the time i expected and it does everything that my old phone did if not a little better ,5
366,just got it yesterday  too soon to tell about battery   it was fully charged when it arrived  fingerprint reader worked ,5
367,the phone has a line on the back glass and this was not in the description,4
368,has been working good  was in great condition  no problems ,5
369,i received an iphone in good condition but a battery life of under     i contacted the seller and got a response immediately with an offer for either a replacement or a credit to replace the battery at either apple or best buy  great response time and options to fix the issue ,5
370,udate… today i turned on my phone  removed some apps and checked fb  i have been on the phone for   minutes…my battery is at   percent…i bought to upgrade for a trip to europe in july  because of a problem switching my service to t mobile  i just got it set up for use monday evening  the battery life on this device is none existent  i charged my phone monday evening and again around noon on tuesday i have already charge my phone twice today  used it for less than     hours total to check email  fb  and make   call  i briefly used my calculator to add up a proposal  i am now racing the battery to complete this review  so i will now be going home and charging for the third time  i am   and worked all day today to give you some insight into how much i used this phone don’t buy from this company… complete garbage    ,1
371,i upgraded from an iphone   to an iphone    i had been looking around and saw this refurbished one on amazon for    and decided to take a chance on it  i also had    of credits to use  i figured it s backed by amazon with their   day warranty too  i don t play games or watch movies or any of those things so i didn t need to get the newest iphone that s out there  my old one had   this one has    so i m getting   times what i had  i like the smaller size too which is another reason why i got the    they do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger   the charger lasted   days and broke  good thing my old charger works on it  i ve only had it for a week but so far  so good  i will update my review after i ve had the phone longer ,4
372,not enough memory,5
373,i was looking for an older model iphone with a good amount of life left in it  since the   isn’t sold new anywhere  this refurbished option seemed worth a try  upon arrival the phone was unlocked and in great shape with only a few minor scrapes on the outside edge  battery life was at    of original  the only small problem i was having was that the response to touch on the screen was intermittent  something with which i could probably manage i decided to ask the seller about a replacement  once i started the return process  with a request for a replacement  the seller communicated very quickly and had a label for me to mail the old phone back that same day the replacement came in as quickly as the old went out  it had a more responsive touch screen and even better battery life  so far no other problems i am very happy with the used   renewed phone and even happier that the seller was so easy to work with  thanks seller was pdi mobile ,5
374,i actually got this phone a last month it came on october   even though they said it would come on the    that could depend on your experience and where you live or the service but that’s how it was for me  i use it about everyday  and it’s literally the best  when it came it was so clean  no scratches anywhere  it only came with the cable which was good because i’m an android user and i only had android chargers and a android back plug  luckily the cable fit the android back  the camera quality is amazing  and every thing works   when the battery starts getting low the back of it heats up not terribly but it gets hot  overall i love it,5
375,got this particular phone because it came from hybrid it who gets great reviews from others  phone was in nearly perfect condition  just a few barely noticeable scratches  one negative is the    battery  although it’s guaranteed to be at least     hence the   stars  not     i’ll replace it at some point but still way less expensive than a brand new phone  it came with a charging cord   adapter  screen protector  and a sim card removal tool  i was able to easily backup the new phone from icloud and move the sim card with no problems at all  very happy so far and hope no issues arise  if they do i’ll come back here with an update ,4
376,the battery health was lower than advertisedit came with    instead of atleast   one of the volume rockers were mushy instead of clickotherwise it was fully functionalno other problems,3
377,battery health is    which is pretty good only downside i have is the corners  i’m not sure what is causing it  but you can see in the corners on the picture that there is something off with the screen ,4
378,mine came with basically zero noticeable wear  some slight imperfections around the charging port was all i could find  this device is performant and reliable despite it s age which is a great indication for the coming years as cellphones get more expensive and out of reach in a few years i may replace this device with something slightly newer but i have come to very much enjoy the renewed program side note  my battery was down to    health which was a very cheap and painless replacement at a local repair shop ,4
379,my iphone was scheduled to be delivered the day after the long labor day weekend  but it actually arrived the friday before  which was an unexpected surprise  there were no scratches at all on the body or screen of the phone  it looked to be in virtually perfect cosmetic shape  once i got it running from my icloud backup everything seemed to work exactly as expected  and now a week later still is functioning perfectly   the camera takes excellent photos  the screen is slightly better than my iphone   it replaced  and wireless charging seems to work perfectly  no excess heat  not overly slow  my only possible complaint with the phone is that it came in with a slightly lower battery health percentage than i was hoping for      i was hoping i d get something in the low to mid   s still for battery health  but i get a full day with moderate to heavy use so can t really complain about that   all in all i wouldn t hesitate to recommend the phone or buyspry,4
380,this seller company are amazing between contacting them and amazon both replaced my phone  my replaced phone was also sent with extra goodies  a screen protector and protective phone case  with the phone and charger  it did not come with sim card key which was fine because i was happy to get the free screen protector and protective phone cover i can improvise and get the sim card in and out and i only needed to unlock it to put the sim card in so not a big deal at all  i give this company a satisfaction guaranteed  and will def use them in the future if needed ,4
381,i was looking for a reasonably priced iphone   and happened to stumble upon this phone  i was skeptical at first because it was the cheapest i could find anywhere online  however  i couldn’t be happier with my purchase  the phone was advertised as a renewed phone that could vary on the degree of visual usage and battery health  aside from one scratch on the back glass  the phone is flawless  the battery is also running at    capacity which was one of the most important categories for me when buying a new phone  i also checked the imei number and model number to find out more information  i was very happy to find that the phone was only   months old  and basically brand new with all original parts  this checked all the boxes and i couldn’t be happier with my purchase  for any one that cares my order was fulfilled by cr land  who has their orders fulfilled by amazon  you can feel safe knowing that if you have to return your item or have any issues you will be dealing with amazon directly  you will not be dealing with the store front who supplies the product which is a plus since amazons return process is relatively painless  i would definitely recommend this product to another person just make sure you watch the prices  they often change and you may miss out on a deal that is up to    less than what is usually offered ,5
382,battery has problem and won’t charge my phone properly at all getting a refund knee this was too good to be true  needed time to get a new phone so i can send back and during the time the phone dont even cut on anymore its just be a horrible process i just want my money back havent even been   days smh,2
383,i thought this phone would be a little easier to handle but is actually worse than the se  i can hardly hold it without it slipping from my hands  there is a protective cover on the screen which i respect  but in doing so they also covered the button in the middle  i m not sure what to call it  but you push down on it to navigate to another open screen  i had to turn around and order a case protector to keep myself from buying another phone  one more thing  it is the same as the iphone se just a few inches bigger  shm,3
384,one of the phones i bought     has a odd quirk  the brightness won’t stay where i set it it keeps going back to a default setting  but other than that the phones work fine ,4
385,i’ve only had the phone   days  i wanted the simplicity of my iphone   but the workhorse of an    i was so happy this morning to wake up to a fully charged phone  it lasted all day while listening to podcasts   music  that is a treat for this gramma  thank you ,4
386,so  many negative reviews describe issues with phone  scratches  battery life  etc i took a risk as the price was decent for a newer mode   gb phone to upgrade my older   gb one yes  mine came with a battery life of    but that was way better than my old iphone came in a simple box with off brand but working charging block and wire  with sim card push pin at the moment  about a week   i can say the phone looks and works amazing looks brand new  works smooth  updated to ios   with no issues the negative reviews here seem legit  but my experience was great  and for the price of      felt it was worth the risk and amazon has a good return policy i am super happy with purchase  and encourage people to weigh the risks  and order with plan to return if it isn’t ideal  but know that i love my new phone ,5
387,good,4
388,i bought this iphone as a birthday gift for my younger sister  i was a bit skeptical at first because i had never bought a phone through amazon but i decided to go ahead and give it a shot because of the cheap price  here in my country  the dr  it is usually around   bucks   i was not really expecting much  well  i was shocked when i saw how well packaged it was and the fact that it  doesn t have a single scratch  it really is factory unlocked and the battery life is quite decent  items it came with are generic  just like it s stated on the description  i bought this phone back in february   and decided to give it at least   months before i wrote a review  no complaints at all so far  i definitely recommend this seller ,5
389,i gave this four starts because the part where you slide up from the bottom to get you to be able to turn your flashlight and data and stuff on doesn’t work very well and the screen also doesn’t work super great all the time ,3
390,good phone  the one i got didn’t have functioning lower speakers  and the screen had a few cracks  it was refurbished  just thought it would have been a little more refurbished ,3
391,amazon and this seller saved my life  my other phone broke and i had to make a quick decision  i went to   walmarts and neither carried what i needed this phone shipped faster than expected  it works like new     battery life  and stuck my chip in and immediately got a phone call no problem  not missing a beat recommend  ,5
392,for those who are on the fence about upgrading to a refurbished iphone    this product works just like it should  for a phone that is  something marketed for the iphone   and newer are its water and dust resistance  this phone lacks the seal  the one i received has its bottom left screen popping up at times  thus i would not try to test the water resistance in any way or form  other than that it is unlocked  very fast  long lasting battery life and great speakers ,4
393,don’t need a lot of bells and whistles but wanted more memory than i had on my iphone    got what a wanted for a good price ,5
394,it was doing good for a month or two  then after that it got to the point it would die every   hours  then it got to  the point it would not work with out a charger  but after i got a new battery it works just fine ,3
395,it was still a good value  but when it came  settings informed me the battery was degraded with     not    as listed  of it s original capacity and peak performance compromised  the battery would plunge by about half after just a   facetime call  settings  the app itself recommend servicing so i took it s advice and got the battery replaced at an apple certified bestbuy near me  luckily they had the battery in stock and it was done in a few hours  the service cost    tax  they informed me that apple s replacement iphone    which is actually new and was circulated for the purpose  totaled  claim replacements insurance  was    at the end of the day  i have a phone that functions just as new and i came across it a tad under   bucks less than brand new sealed package iphone    so  still a good value just took a little more effort and time ,3
396,better than what i thought it would be ,5
397,the camera is complete trash and and battery life has seen better days,2
398,as expected  the battery was not at    capacity but it was higher than expected at    there’s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order i did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did  the screen protector was already in place so i didn’t have to use the one i bought and i will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case i need it later this was listed as a fully unlocked iphone and i believe it has arrived as such  it will definitely work for the carrier i initially intended  which is cricket i believe my little sister has a step up from this phone  the   plus  and she’s still paying for her phone through the provider  i’ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so i’m glad it worked out  if anything happens within the next   days before the amazon warranty expires i’ll be sure to update  definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone  as accidents do happen ,5
399,when i received the device it didn t work   it wouldnt go past the reigon screen for setting it up   i sent it back it took over a week for the merchant too receive it they had too re send and claims now that it s on the way i m beyond frustrated with this because this was supposed too be my daughter s birthday gift   a friend of mine ordered the exact same phone from the exact same place color model and all and also sent too fayetteville nc and it was having the same issues wouldn t go past the reigon screen i feel like when she sent that one back they resent it back too me why not just throw it away if it was having issues  ,1
400,i’m very happy with the phone all but the battery that doesn’t keep charge or maintain life for long periods of time which would have been nice to have been warned that its battery life is at    … refurbished phones are like drawing straws once in a while you get lil jipped,3
401,excellent condition and came and description as advertised  nice looking phone with all the components  as was stated ,5
402,the phone arrived in great condition  no visible scratches and everything seems to work  very pleased with the fit and finish  the battery health reads    after a few days of use  when i thought to check it  entirely possible the vendor shipped it with    remaining i am replacing an xr  and i have to say i forgot how limited my last iphone  ’s battery capacity was when it gave up the ghost  if you are replacing an iphone   this may not be a big deal  but i’m going to have to charge multiple times a day if i talk for any amount of time  just keep charges around your home  office  and vehicles and this shouldn’t be a problem  i feel that was the one trade off i made with a refreshed unit battery life ,4
403,i have bought several renewed products from amazon and they all worked well  pleased with this iphone  looks like new and working great ,5
404,el teléfono no parece para nada nuevo aunque se sabe que es reacondicionado  y la vida útil de la batería es baja se descarga muy rápido pienso que si van a vender teléfono así la batería debería estar al   por ciento,3
405,i got that phone for my wife and it doesn t charge it charges and then if the phone it just doesn t charge i don t want to go through the hazards of sending it back and waiting for another phone,2
406,phone arrived on time and in pretty much brand new condition  i was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews but i had no issues even after using the phone for over a week now  didn’t have any issues putting service on it either  will definitely use this vendor again ,5
407,i have found nothing that i don’t like about this phone so far  i know i just bought it and got it yesterday  but i started using it immediately  i love the speed compared to my wife’s iphone    i was replacing an iphone   that had gotten so bad that i had to struggle just to do something with it  but even compared to the iphone   it is also tremendously more responsive  i bought a wireless recharger and this phone recharges quickly for this to be a refurbished phone  it is so far outstanding and it is hard to believe it is not new  i am the kind of a person who calls a spade a spade  if it is good  i say it is good  if a product is bad i don’t make excuses for it  i will say it’s bad  i am totally satisfied thanks  refurbishes for an outstanding job ,5
408,the phone looks good cosmetically but go ahead and order a battery  look up the videos to learn how to change it bc the phone will only work for   minutes after fully charging it all day ,3
409,came exactly as described and was just like buying a brand new phone from the store  didn’t even seem to have wear or couldn’t tell it was used any at all  also was completely charged when i got it and had no problems setting it up   been about   weeks now and haven’t had any issues ,5
410,came in pretty good condition–the screen had a small scuff in the corner and the casing was chipped around the camera port  once i got a case and screen protector on it  it looked like a brand new phone  battery caps at    which might as be full  the fingerprint reader is fully functional too  phone was fully unlocked as promised and compatible with my old sim card  i was a little scared after reading some of the reviews  but the phone i received was better than advertised  its only been a day or so though  so if anything goes wrong with it ill update my review,5
411,my first time getting a renewed phone but the seller had great reviews and it lived up to it  happy purchased,5
412,replacement of an iphone  ,5
413,this iphone   is high quality   everything works with the typical smoothness and polish of apple products   the layout is logical  the settings are easy to find and configure and the apps for the most part are very good   as described the iphone   is a solid no frills phone that does all the basics very well   i would recommend   memory which i have  rather than   if you load many apps i have been a samsung android user for years   samsung is no slouch either and i might even give a slight edge on functionality of some of the apps to samsung   but i like being in the apple ecosystem and the iphone quality is hard to beat   i switched from a pc laptop to a mac a couple of years ago and really love it   this phone completes my switch to apple ,5
414,two of these worked perfectly  the third had problems with the screen  and the battery ,2
415,shipping was super fast  arriving a day early  the phone was in good condition  as described  there is an area of scratches on the screen  but it’s in the top right and not on the actual touchscreen area  with a screen protector they’re not even viable  everything works perfectly so far  and battery life is superior to my previous phone’s battery that was only about a year old i was absolutely thrilled to find they included a screen protector in the box  i don’t remember seeing that mentioned in what was included  but it absolutely made my day since it meant i didn’t have to run out to get one or order one and wait for it to arrive  that little bit of thoughtfulness on the seller’s part completely won me over on the whole transaction  and really impressed me ,5
416,i bought the iphone      it looked like new when i received it  it did not come in the original iphone box  it came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for sim card  it worked great in every aspect except that i noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iphone    the sound was more “tinny” sound  probably not noticeable to others  but it was for me  i don’t know if it was a defect or how the iphone   was made  it just startled me when i would use it for an alarm clock playing music  i did not have any problem at all returning the iphone  the package came with a card that had their phone number and email address  backed by amazon  there is a   day warranty and i turned it back in shortly before the   days was up  when i spoke with the customer service  they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iphone  i was sent an email with the return label and i sent it back with no problem and got a full refund  even though the phone did not work out for me  i would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do ,5
417,had some issues getting the phone to function  had to reload software a couple of times before itunes would work correctly still getting notifications asking if app can use location even after going through all the settings a couple times  not sure if that is an issue with all iphone   or just this one ,3
418,revived phone in very good condition however  the charging cable works only half of the time battery life is very poor  still a good phone but cheap charging cable and substandard battery is a big letdown,3
419,this was my first time buying an unlocked phone  let alone a refurbished one  it was delivered a day early and in pristine condition  you would never know this was used  not a scratch on it and the battery life is perfect  it was so easy to activate with my provider  zero issues  i will definitely be buying unlocked phones from now on ,5
420,the phone battery performance is not optimal   i accidentally dropped the phone and the front screen damaged  so i took it to a repair center for screen replacement and that’s when we noticed there were several screws inside the phone are missing  the phone is not useless ,3
421,although these  both that i ordered  were listed as renewed new the battery life is less than     under the status report in settings  and one is stating needs service  i expect that as renewed there d be some degradation but not  needs service ,3
422,at first i thought i got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box  which sounds fine at first  but the box had the details of a completely different phone so i was sweating a bit when i saw that  the phone was correct  though  and came in good condition  it wasn t perfect  as you d expect from a refurbished phone  there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner  but that doesn t bother me one bit since it s covered by my case  i think that    is a good price for a well refurbished iphone    since it also comes with the trust that it s in top renewed condition versus buying for less from fb marketplace or something like that  i also purchased the protection plan which covers drops  cracks  water damage  etc  and it is well worth it to me  after the initial    payment  paying    to have my phone repaired or    to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me ,5
423,so far so good   love the bigger screen and the fact it is an upgrade from my little   which was the perfect size   still not sure about the battery which seems to go down quicker than i think it should  phone has bigger gbs than the   so that may be using up more battery power  we shall see  having fun learning the new things this phone will do  folks did a nice job refurbishing and the previous owner took good care of it  cosmetically it it great ,4
424,i gotta be honest i didn t expect to get a damn near perfect iphone   it was sim locked to at t but less than   minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone i was able to insert my sim card then use it on the cricketwireless service there is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn t a problem because a case would cover it up easily  other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else  battery is great  no cloud lock and everything functions normally i don t know if i got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but i am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a   day warranty is a plus thank you for blessing me with a phone i could give to my mom cuz she loves having touchid and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too  even though she s never going to use it  ,5
425,phone has new battery  battery life was at    when received  money well spent ,5
426,very happy with this purchase  the phone received works perfectly and looks brand new  with the exception of a few minor discoloration marks on the top and side edges  looks like pressure points from being in a case   each roughly half the width of my pinkie   battery life at    capacity  no complaints ,5
427,i was pleased with everything except the battery life  though i should have expected that from an older phone  however  lot of times during the process of refurbishing batteries get changed ,3
428,the phone looks good  but it won’t charge with all chargers  but it’s not an issue with the charger as i have other apple devices  also  the battery life is only    so it will have to be replaced  with a refurbished phone  i would expect a decent battery,3
429,i purchased this phone over a year ago   it has worked fine   however  i had a lot of trouble when i switched to another provider from at t   this phone is actually japanese model     the imei could not be unlocked by at t because it is actually locked by kddi japan which apparently allows at t sim cards to work   i am still in process of getting this phone unlocked as the unlock process is far more complicated than it would be with an actual at t device ,4
430,it is a great way to save a lot of money  an iphone that behaves the same as one purchased from the apple store directly,5
431,if you re looking for a cheap  temporary option this is a good option  but mine has stopped functioning about a year after my purchase  i can only use it while it s on the charger otherwise it dies ,3
432,this phone came in great shape   it included a brand new apple   charger  apple lightning cable  and sim tool   i highly recommend buying this product from trademore as they bundled an apple charger  i m pretty sure some sellers only include a generic brick    amazon renewed guarantees a minimum of    battery health  mine came with      overall  this device is in great shape   there are a few minor scratches on metal parts of the phone  the back glass is in flawless condition   the screen has a few very minor scratches that are only visible when held up to a light   the charging port  wireless charging  touch id  volume buttons  bluetooth  wifi  and cellular all work flawlessly   i bought the fully unlocked version and it works great on verizon   all in all  i highly recommend this amazon renewed iphone   ,5
433,it’s a great phone great price  nothing wrong so far so   stars,5
434,it was in excellent condition just as stated   very clean and packaged nicely   arrived on time    thank you,5
435,the phone was so good and worked fine but there was scratches  not that many tho and the scratches weren’t that noticeable ,4
436,i usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new  i found this listing and i will admit that i was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were  i contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that i could be assured that this would be a good purchase  they were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and apple i received the product and it was in mint condition  the phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever  it has been working perfectly for   months now  and i could not be happier with my purchase the packaging clearly wasn t original and the charger was not oem  but this is stated in the product description so i knew what i was getting into  no big deal if you re the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about     this is an excellent option for you additionally  i had no problems switching this phone over on my verizon account  as long as you are a verizon customer  this should be an easy process through the verizon app thanks ,5
437,the phone was in great condition  all i had to do is charge it and take it to my t mobile outlet to have it setup and ready to use  it was a great purchase and i’m very pleased with it  i highly recommend it so if you have any second thoughts about purchasing a reconditioned phone from amazon  don’t  you won’t be sorry ,5
438,i am a   year old girl  and i payed my own money for this phone  it came in the mail on the last day that it said it would  so kind of on time  the only cosmetic problem is that the outer ring of the camera is a bit scratched  but you can hardly see it  the touch screen works perfectly  the fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty  but that is the only time  i put in my left thumb  right thumb  left pointer  and right pointer into the thing and all of them work    of the time  the battery life is good  but i leave it on dark mode  true tone off  and i always like to keep the brightness down  the phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings  and so if you’re in a dark room  it goes dark and vice versa  overall the phone is great  and i definitely recommend it  especially for the price  i hope that this review is helpful ,5
439,apple iphone    at t prepaid  made sure that i selected a model for my carrier   it showed up   was very easy to swap sim cards and transfer all my stuff  mirrored everything to the new phone   battery life was      and the phone looked brand new   very happy for what i paid ,5
440,phone work good but the battery life is bad  i’m always charging the phone ,3
441,had this phone for less than   months and it will no longer take charge to the phone  apple store diagnosed that the charging port is no longer working and the wireless charging is not taking power as well will need to replace the entire phone and that would cost starting at    which is more than twice the renewed phone cost  very disappointed with the renew purchase ,2
442,my concerns when purchasing a refurbished or renewed iphone would be   is it what i ordered  yes  an iphone   with   gb   are there scratches on the shell  no  some scratches would have been acceptable  since i would put the phone in a case anyway   are there scratches on the glass  no  in fact the phone had a protective film installed  probably by the original owner    is the battery in good shape  sort of  battery health  maximum capacity reports     that s the only disappointment  i imagine that battery health will vary ,4
443,phone works as expected except it is intermittent charging  tested and found charging port is very worn and charging cable interface is unreliable ,3
444,okay for beginners this would be a wonderful refurbished iphone to start off with  you still got one of the greatest tech apple made  and the prettiest design    but for those of us who have more of a expectation then i would recommend buying new  you won’t get the best battery life in the phone industry  and with the device having been renewed you do lose things like battery capacity with the age of the device  also buttons like mine will lose there tack tile feed back and become more mushy and hard to detect if you pressed it or not  last but not least the sim card tray was handled with less then desired care as mine did come bent where you enter your sim tool into    all these problems can be fixed with off the shelf parts  but might cost you more the  you desire  over all shipping was a great success and came early  device does come completely unlocked including icloud unlocked  and does include a third party charger and power brick ,3
445,we ve purchased two refurbished phones through this amazon program  an iphone     an iphone    both were in perfect condition and wiped clean with no issues  the   even came with a protective glass screen we just had to put in the sim card  restore from icloud  and they were good to go  we ve had the   for about six months and the   for a week  i would buy from them again and would recommend to others  great price for our preteens  first phones ,5
446,actually need the home button     as long as there is a home button we will never upgrade to anything else   three out of four of us here stuck on iphone   just because it has a home button     ,5
447,this phone is great but when it came there was a big black mark on the corner of the screen and it’s still there ,3
448,my kid thinks it is new i’m happy with great deal  definitely recommend seller,5
449,purchased the iphone      it arrived on    it was packaged    the overall appearance of the phone was beyond good  i believe we could only find one very small scratch on the case when held a certain way in the light    no problems at all setting up    seriously  it s like new we got this for my daughter to replace her iphone   that only had   phone storage  this phone is perfect for her  she s a teen that uses all the social apps and the   handle them all plus pics and vids we went with this seller because of all the good reviews  the offer of a   day warranty  i feel that i made the best choice for a refurbished phone  in a couple  we will purchase from this seller again ,5
450,really like it very nice,4
451,the phone came as described in awesome packaging  as in  not just a cardboard box   the phone works great  it s fast compared to my iphone se  and was nearly flawless cosmetically  it had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs  but that was covered up by the case i purchased  besides  cosmetics don t affect the performance of the phone something i was a little leery about was the description  so here s my experience  the phone i received was unlocked and works great with ting  the description said unlocked  but some reviewers mentioned that they received a gsm phone  and i was looking for cdma  i received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network  i purchased from buyspry  i hope they don t mind i mentioned them it is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked  however  if the description specifies a specific network like  unlocked gsm   then the phone will only work on gsm networks  make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions  that s what i did and it worked out to my benefit ,5
452,parece  nuevo,5
453,i did have to take it to metro to get it turned on but it works great the charger works great no cracks scratches or any thing wrong with it volume is amazing everything is great ,5
454,i had to have a new phone and this was my best deal  i really like it  but am still getting adjusted to it  it keeps moving the icons around so  i have to search for them   i assume this is apple and not the phone  this is very annoying and i can t figure out why and how to stop it   sometimes it just eliminates an icon  i still can t find facebook  instagram  and emails  but i am  technology challenged   so perhaps my grandson can help me when he gets out of school ,4
455,se congela al tomar foto de ambas partes eso no lo decia en la especificaciones,4
456,i ve only had my phone for a day  but right now it looks perfect  there s a very small scratch on the outside of the phone but that s about it  the screen is fine  i was able to set it up easily  and there s been no issues thus far  was pretty scared about getting it at first because of the bad reviews and how awful they said it was  but it worked out great for me  charger works as well  hope it works out for anyone else planning on buying it  oh  also i got it three days early  so that was a huge plus  i kept looking at the tracking just waiting for it to get here lol ,5
457,we only use the basics…calls  texts  and pictures  we gave up a jitterbug to go to the iphone   and like the   much better  only complaint is the one that i feel about all apple products and services  that is  i feel apple is very intrusive and controlling  trying to  subtly  force folks into apple patterns and services ,4
458,we first ordered an iphone   refurbished and it had the feature where you could not turn off the shutter sound and the speaker was tinny sounding  they respond within seconds of receiving messages through amazon and were happy to send a shipping label for the return and ship a replacement  in order to avoid downtime  i decided just to order a new phone first and return the first phone once the new one was received  which i proceeded to do  without prompting  hybrid it shipped overnight fedex the replacement phone so i received it the very next day  on top of that  the new phone has    battery health     excellent customer service   ,5
459,i bought this phone for my son since we’ve canceled our landline  he uses it for games and to facetime or message me when he’s not with me  i paid the higher price for the better battery life  while the phone did arrive with    life remaining  it drains within minutes of use and it needs constant charging  the phone itself states it needs service and a battery replacement  i guess if you want an adorable iphone  that’s what you get  but expect to replace the battery when it arrives  the phone itself arrived in new condition  no obvious imperfections  had i know i’d be replacing the battery right away i would not have purchased the more expensive phone ,2
460,works like new    everything works   best decision i made   was skeptical at first was thinking of ordering my daughter a brand new android phone but since i am an apple sheep i decided to look for a refurbished iphone   my   year old rlly enjoys facetiming her cousins and more since we live far from our family   it’s very simple to use,5
461,cannot tell this phone was ever used,5
462,the phone case looks new  the screen has one small scratch next to the home button   but it doesn t affect screen images   it was advertised to have at least   percent battery life   this one has exactly      overall it s in very good condition   i gave it a   star rating  however  if its remaining battery life had been higher i would have given it a   star rating ,4
463,i am very pleased with the quality of the phone i received   the renewed premium quality is true to its description  my iphone arrived with no cosmetic damage visible at all  not even when the device is scrutinized   battery health upon deliver was      the battery charge level upon arrival was     indicating that care was taken with the handling of this device   device was packaged with care  all microphones  cameras and speakers operate with no flaws at all   additionally  the iphone arrived very clean  with no debris or lint in the charging port or speaker areas   grills over mics speakers were clean and perfectly intact as well   i could not be more pleased with this product ,5
464,this product was what i expected,5
465,all is well with the ph  except the camera lens  it has a glue on the lens which distort the pics  have tried to remove it with no luck ,3
466,i can’t really say any about this phone except the recipient was extremely happy with there birthday day gift ,4
467,i was surprised at how new the phone looked when we opened the package   we were expecting some normal wear for a refurbished product  but it was spotless   inserted a sim card and we were off and running   very pleased ,5
468,the iphone   i received was better than expected  the screen had very minor scruffs under the home button that could only be seen when holding the phone at odd angles  there was also a bigger scuff in the bottom corner of the back glass but was fixed with a case  other then those minor issues the phone was great  it came in on time  had good packaging  battery life was way better than expected  and was overall a great purchase  that i would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap iphone ,4
469,so far so good,4
470,for almost    iphone   regular i thought was not too bad of a price i mean honestly i think it’s still high  but we needed a phone so i bought one for myself and one for my husband  mine you’d have to have the charger adapter for to the phone set a certain way just so that it would stay charging  half the time the charge would be down with his a few minutes  not having  but there were no scratches no dents came in great condition  and like i do a lot of telemedicine and my doctors either couldn’t see me at the time or couldn’t hear me so that’s gonna go into a trade in program or donated to veterans,3
471,i ordered this phone       because i needed to upgrade my older iphone due to internal issues and i didn’t have     to spend on a brand new one  i found this refurbished   and it came to me in like new condition with no scratches  a working charge cord   plug in an official iphone   box and has worked great from day    no issues in the set up process  battery life is superb  i give  for everything    thank you  oh also i was told i would get it on a monday but instead i got it three days before eta date  yay i am sorry to those who had a bad experience with this buyer   the bad phones they got  glad i was one of the lucky ones ,5
472,the phone feels very study  the battery life if great  i got the phone yesterday and have been trying to set it up  i attempted to create an apple acct  but it stated too many people  have created an acct with this phone  unable to create an account  i also tried to download a free game in the apple store and it said i  had to pay for it  which tells me this phone is not completely unlock  if i continue to have road blocks  i will have to return this phone  even though i really like it  fyi face recognition got a one  because i am unable to create an acct ,5
473,the iphone   was in great condition   so far  it holds a charge just fine  just received it yesterday  ,5
474,no issue with the refurbished and unlocked phone   why pay for a brand new phone when you can get a phone like this that seamlessly works   it s a phone folks   oh the pics are just fine as is everything else that makes it a phone ,4
475,works great,5
476,the seller is sending these devices out with power adapters and cables that aren’t mfi compatible  this could cause damage to the phone ,2
477,this phone was not unlocked for at t as was advertised so i can not use it   even though it said it could only be used on at t  it can not   i rated this a one     because the seller initially appeared to be responsive  now i wish i could give them a negative rating because they are trying to steal my money   i returned the phone and they are saying that i locked the phone by adding a password   this is not true  i have been in a back and forth conversation with them this week as they repeatedly claim that i locked the phone and added icloud   this is ridiculous because i could never access the phone because my at t sim card would not work   i have told them this repeatedly  it was clearly stated in my original correspondence with them   i told them the message that the phone gave when i put my sim card in there     sim card that you currently have installed in this iphone is from a carrier that is not supported under the activation policy that is currently assigned by the activation server     the seller is either intentionally trying to deceive me  with false advertising or  mistakenly sent the wrong phone and won t admit it   i think they are intentionally try to deceive me because when i reported the phone as unlocked  they could have provided instructions for unlocking the phone   instead they said to send it back and are now saying that i put a password on the phone as a reason not to refund or replace the phone   this is so wrong ,1
478,very happy with this phone  looks great  was easy to set up  i was very nervous after reading some of the reviews but again i couldn t be happier with mine ,5
479,the phone was in excellent condition and the charger and lightning cable  both after market  were of good quality my issue was with the state of the phone  if this was thoroughly inspected as claimed  the phone should have been erased   it wasn t  there were no user files or data but carrier information was still there  i ve purchased used iphones before and they were always reset to factory  that does a couple of things  ist it completely clears any data    and more important it sets the phone up for connecting it to your carrier account and easily restoring from a backup it s not that hard to do so it only took a few minutes  but it should have shipped that way ,4
480,the phone is not “unlocked” like it says it was  so the phone only works on wifi  i have to now return this useless phone because it is incompatible with my carrier  even though it’s said to be unlocked edit  i had to go in store and they had to explain to me how to what the situation was with the phone and how to actually be able to use it ,4
481,replaced an older iphone   with the iphone   that i received from amazon excellent condition everything was in the box so they said it would be even a little tool for taking out the sim card great job amazon thank you,5
482,the phone itself was in good shape and as described on te website   unfortunately the battery life was not    as indicated   when received that was the first hung i check and it was only      although only      that is a significant difference in the life of the battery  ,3
483,alright so i wanted to give it some time before i wrote a review on our phone  in case we came across any problems with it   fortunately  we’ve had our iphone   since december now it’s january and have had zero problems with it  the phone actually came in pristine condition  no scratches or blown out distorted speaker or any other problems  i do see that there’s others here that  sadly  have problems with their phone from the minute they receive it and i think it has a lot to do with the seller  before i purchased our phone i checked the different sellers and ratings reviews and ultimately we went with hybrid it  take a look for yourselves  i strongly recommend this seller for anyone looking to get one of these phones ,5
484,after a many moons with my i phone   it was time for a new phone   i shopped and researched   quickly  one realizes a refurbished phone is the best deal   however i was afraid of the sim card thing and got cold feet   many have told me how easy it is so i did it   wow it is easy   you kick yourself for being afraid of something so easy   since i do not have large data on my phone i just repeated my contacts and i love my refurbished i phone    it is as clean as a new one   works much better with reception and hearing quality,5
485,i used my sisters amazon bc it’s easier but i’m a single mom on a budget and i needed something cheap but good and even refurbished this was all i could afford and i read every review and some kinda irritated me its a refurbished phone what do you expect   but     it’s amazing thank you to this seller you’re amazing    thank you also the phone is definitely     love it    it also came in super early     ,5
486,i’m a teenager and i wanted to get my mom a phone because her old one died  this phone came in good condition but there was some minor scratch and some dirts  but  the battery life was      i was shocked  at first  when i settled up the phone  i had a little trouble and there was at one point where the phone shut off completely and didn’t open but that was because of transferring data  but so far i’m happy with this purchase  just imply with the scratch  started off a bit scary  but then everything was good ,4
487,this is my   iphone    and i m very happy with my purchase   being i m on disability  i don t have the money for a newer model but i m very happy with this purchase,5
488,the phone worked great for the first   months  but three days before the return time frame expired it began having some charging issues  and screen flip issues  i didn’t want to just do a return because all my son’s data has been entered into the phone  i messaged the seller to see if we could exchange the phone  and if they could send the replacement first so we could sync his data to the new phone  but i never heard back from them  now the return time has expired  and i still haven’t heard from the seller  guess i’m stuck with a    paper weight,3
489,not sure if people aware that when we buy a renewed phone at amazon  it is sold by different vendors depending on the version  size  color you choose  it is very important to check who is actually selling the phone   ensure that they have a good rating  my black iphone       was purchased from hybridit which has a    positive rating  a shout out to hybridit  the phone was cosmetically flawless      functional  the battery health is at    which is very good considering the age  i’m    satisfy  so  an advice to fellow amazon purchaser  please check the vendor’s reputation before buying      ,5
490,la bateria nomas dura una hora no buena,3
491,updating the iphone reviewi had it now for   months now and haven t had any problemsthe battery life is as good as new and it s works greatgreat phonecame with a solid color and no damagegreat battery life  as near as long as the original iphone  ,5
492,the product came without sim trayi had to order a sim tray online  i wasn’t very happy about it  even though the tray not very expensive  but still check your product before shipping  they offer me a partial refund which was a nice gesture and very appreciated ,5
493,the phone is exactly as described  works great it has a small scratch on the screen and a couple chipped spots on the bottom from being dropped before i got it  but that’s expected and does not effect functionality customer service was great  somewhere along the shipping route the package was cut open  the phone was removed from the box and was put back into the package and taped shut  i had to contact seller about the missing phone seller was fantastic  i got an answer fast and they graciously sent a replacement  that made it to me this time  without charging me for another phone  thank you very much very happy with my order  ,5
494,battery life is poor too,3
495,i thank the seller because i was skeptical about the purchase and debated for a bit before taking the leap and purchasing  i am so glad that i did  i can understand why the seller is listed as the best and are ranked as     just like others who purchased this phone  i expected it to have issues and not be worth the purchase  however  i received the phone   days earlier than noted  it also arrived literally looking brand new and it works as if i had just purchased a brand new iphone  let s just say i am overly excited that i got such a deal and an amazing purchase  i am ready to buy all kinds of cases and accessories for my new phone  yay ,5
496,the seller got the phone here very quickly  it was packed as indicated and included charger that seems to work well  the phone aesthetically looks great  scratch free as far as i can tell  no trouble operating  needed updating to the latest ios  the only disappointing part is the battery condition  these renewed phones are guaranteed to come with batteries that have at least    capacity left  mine came in at     so technically its acceptable but unfortunately i will be spending another    soon for a new battery because it does not last under a day of light moderate use  so don t think you are getting a nice iphone   at     it will cost you more like    when all is said and done ,5
497,fast shipping and easy to set up   i owned my iphone   for at least five years so it was time for an upgrade   i had seriously considered  and had in my cart  an iphone xr  however  when i contacted my carrier who has familiarity  with iphones  she indicated that the xr does not have a home key and that some customers did not like this or had problems adjusting to it   she recommended i go with the iphone   and i did   i should add that i am the least mechanically inclined person   i had no difficulty transferring my data from my iphone   to my iphone   via icloud   while i just received the phone today and haven t had time to fully explore it  i am pleased with my purchase and i made the right choice   considering this is a renewed phone it s in great shape ,5
498,came in working perfect condition  exactly like new  came a day early as well  i have had zero issues with this phone ,5
499,the phone was a second phone used in the country of jamaica whenever traveling not all features we’re working but it serves the purpose,4
500,satisfecho gracias por todo me incluyeron cargador,5
501,i ordered an iphone      they did not clean the charging port  neither the speakers  and the phone screen on the side is lifting a little  but overall the phone is good  the speakers is still working and the phone is still charging  there aren t any scratches at all  just thought since it is refurbished and they said in the information that it would be cleaned i expected it to be cleaned,4
502, i bought this for my son to be placed on my current verizon network plan     so  ok  let me start by saying that i received the phone via   day prime shipping  phone came in a generic box  but sufficient for transport  it included the charger and   charging cable  nothing else  unboxed  the phone was in excellent cosmetic condition  not a single scratch anywhere  i powered it on  the display was beautiful and worked as it should  at that point i ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son  its his b day present      then i took the phone to verizon store and had them put a verizon sim in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan     well guess what    this phone is a model    and it is only gsm carrier compatible  not cdma  which is what verizon is     but yet  this phone was advertised as   for verizon    which is the only reason i went ahead and bought it  the verizon models are        so i have given the review   stars because of the great cosmetic  great camera and fully functional condition   but because they lied  and did not send me what i purchased  a phone for verizon networks   i do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to advertise one thing  then send you another  where i come from we call that a big fat lie    and i do not put up with liars  therefore i  reporting themfor false advertisement and hopefully they will be kicked off of amazon,2
503,product was as described and was operational in   minutes  it came with a charging block and cable  it had only one screen nick that disappeared when the screen protector  not included  was applied  i would definitely buy from them agaim ,5
504,my son loves it,5
505,i’m very pleased with my phone  i was so nervous to order because you never know what you’re gonna get  it came in like     condition     battery health   i’ve had it for almost a week and i haven’t had any issues whatsoever  it’s packaged in bubble wrap so it’s safe during the travel  i’m all the way in trinidad and it came looking great  iblueberry was my seller and they did a great job ,5
506,work okay but the battery life is much lower than i expected ,3
507,battery life seems fine  not perfect  but certainly fine for a refurbished product  fingerprint sensor works perfectly  honestly someone could probably have tricked me into thinking this was brand new ,5
508,we purchased this phone in   and used it until about a month ago  the phone worked fine with at t  however  when we were done with it and attempted to sell it  we were informed by gadgettraders that the phone was never fully paid off and was still under contract with at t  in other words  it had a bad esn we reached out to this seller  trademore  to inform them of this to which they replied that the item description indicates that the phone only works with at t  there is a difference between simply being carrier locked  which you can call the carrier to lift  and having a bad esn being an unpaid phone  in our case  the phone will be unable to be unlocked until the original owner has paid off their balance  this violates amazon s policies after informing the seller of this  they simply replied that if we re unhappy with the purchase  we can request a refund within   days  which we re obviously way beyond  my issue is  when you make a purchase  you should be taking full possession of the item to do with as you please  in this case  we were unable to take full ownership of the phone because there was an initial contract that was unfulfilled  i didn t make a purchase on amazon to become a bailee  seller has been completely unhelpful even though they re defrauding customers ,1
509,i ordered the fully unlocked version  when it came in the mail it was in new condition  no scratches or dings  and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out  we have a plan with verizon  i was able to take out my sim from my old iphone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues  my phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone  so far no bugs or glitches  i m very happy with my purchase  there were a lot of mixed reviews so i was skeptical on buying it but i m glad i did  plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective i didn t feel like i would loose my money  my advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version ,5
510,having problems with touching apps or opening apps  it takes three times to text to open it and it’s getting worse,2
511,the item was not my expectation   i returned it  but my refund was not made and no one communicated with me,2
512,i bought a used iphone   and it was amazon certified  i opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever  i wanted to use it for a while before i did a review  i have had it about a month now and i havent had any issues at all with the phone s performance  battery lasts a long time  no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi no wifi i was so leery about getting a used phone  i ve always gone new  when i saw it was only     it s worth a shot vs spending    on a new phone again  they gave me a   day return policy as well for the piece of mind  so far  this was the best bang for buck deal rather than buying a new phone  as long as i dont have any issues in the near future  i will continue to buy used phones from amazon that are certified ,5
513,purchased for my daughter for christmas  it s currently   generations behind but for a   year old who isn t particularly careful with her phone  it has been a good purchase  she is pleased so i am pleased ,4
514,phone was bent a little bit  did not include a sim card drawer  battery is just ok  probably should have went in a different direction ,3
515,i ordered the iphone   on a sunday and it came a few days early which is good  it was suposed to be renewed but the packaging said “new”  and i checked the phone for scuffs or marks or cracks and there was none    so i basically recieved a brand new phone  my battery life is currently at    which isn’t bad at all  and fingerprint reader works excellent  i was able to install ios   on the phone and it runs at great speed even while having many apps open at once  i hope to use this phone until it doesn t serve me any good ,5
516,so far so good  the only qualm i have about this is that the battery was at    capacity  which is when apple recommendations replacing it  so i had to spend an additional    to get a replacement put in at a local store since i need a phone and sending it in and waiting for it to get back to me isn t an option  overall  the phone itself is functioning great and i love the wireless charging feature  i had no problems switching service from my old t mobile phone to this one ,4
517,it came a couple of days before it was expected to which was great  opened the box and it was just the phone and a charger like advertised  i’m very surprised at the look of it  the phone looks like it’s brand new  it works very great  it is unlocked and was easy just to pop in my sim from my iphone   into this iphone    i upgraded from the   to the   because i have had the   for   years now and never gotten it cracked or broken or anything and it works fine but in the last couple of weeks to a month now it seems like the   battery isn’t lasting as long after a charge so instead of finding a place to try to get it replace for god knows how much i figured it was time to upgrade my phone and now i’m glad i did ,5
518,works great,5
519,im a bit skeptical at first whsn it comes to online shopping fot refurbished gadget  but this changes everything  itcomes in pristine almost new condition  the only drawback is the battery health as it comes in    mark  but acceptable enoughfor what i intend to use it for  i was delighted as well how fast the shipment goes  considering where im from  good job seller kudos to you amazon,3
520,the iphone came in nearly perfect condition  only flaw was a tiny scratch near the speakers at the bottom  it had no issues at all running ios    everything runs so smoothly and i was very impressed  i got this phone as a gift for my girlfriend as her first iphone and it does very well to keep up with my iphone xr at times  plus we got another iphone   for her mother a few weeks after with no physical flaws at all  i couldn’t find face recognition but the fingerprint scanner on both phones work as intended  the battery can last a good work day  about     hours  definitely worth checking out for the price ,5
521,el equipo funciona correctamente  la vida útil de la batería fue de     está bien por el precio  estado físico del equipo       pensé que estaría con marca de desgaste pero no  funciona el touch id y todas las demás funciones del teléfono ,5
522,phone came super quick and was easy to put the chip in and start using the phone  everything works great except the speakerphone  which is awful bc that is how i prefer to use the phone when i talk to people ,4
523,first refurbished phone and has definitely set the bar for what i should expect if i were to purchase another  like i mentioned in headline i did have an issue where the home button as it wasn t working but after a trip to the apple store i was able to get this issue fixed and since then i have had no issues with the device  owned iphones for years and each one of them expect this one was bought directly from apple and this device performs like the rest  satisfied customer ,5
524,i had ordered this phone to replace my old version   that was run over by a car  i was concerned about ordering a phone through amazon and wasn t confident that this phone would  be a dysfunctional mess  but so far it has met my expectations and above  everything on it works as it should  so i m satisfied with this purchase ,4
525,i updated from iphone   and ordered the iphone   online   however  i didn’t realize it’s smaller than other iphones   that’s my only complaint  i like everything else about it and the price was great ,4
526,amazon has come thru again  quality price and conveince,5
527,it is very cool and new and really worth buying,5
528,would not buy it again ,2
529,looks like a brand new phone   this is a replacement phone for my child  the price is right and works like a charm ,5
530,the phone is in good condition   like new   a couple of small chips on the edges   not critical   display and back side as new  everything works,5
531,so far  so good   the setting was easy and smooth   it copied my contacts  photos  etc  from my other cell phone   now i have two phones with different numbers but the same settings contents  it labels each as phone as      tmobile is my cell provider   i have been looking for a cell phone that can accommodate   numbers  the last time i checked  i was told that kind of phone doesn t exist  yet     i don t know if that is even possible  however  with today s technology  nothing is impossible  happy to have extra cell phones that i use for my business plus another iphone that i used for personal ,5
532,phone was just like new,5
533,got this phone after my iphone   broke  quickly purchased without looking at customer reviews  this seller has quite a few bad reviews for this particular item listing  however most dating    luck may have played a part or maybe it was the seller having better products than before  i got a scratch less iphone    exactly what i ordered  however battery health shows it only charges to     shows    but doesn’t actually get there  everything else works fine  so   out of  ,4
534,good to have an affordable option for people who can’t afford brand new phones and carriers charged  thank you,5
535,great phone  great price and quick shipping  i love it ,5
536,good product,5
537,hi guys  i got the phone  it was unlocked as advertised  no problem for my carrier and i am in europe  the phone works good for me  i ve had it for a couple of days  although the battery capacity is at     it can hold up to      and a half days with talking and surfing  no charging  it doesn t restart  as some comments here say  which was what i was worried about and really the value for money is great  apart from a couple of dinges on the side  visually the phone was great  it even had a protector on  for the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at     just go change it  it s like   bucks and don t forget this is not a brand new phone  so for a refurbished phone that i got i can say i am pleased ,4
538,this was a beautiful phone and a very good price  everything worked great on it  except  unfortunately  the sound  i could hear everything just fine  but people i called said i sounded like i had my head in a bucket  i ended up returning it  so it might seem strange that i am reviewing it  but just wanted to let buyers know that the   day return makes it easy to take a chance on a renewed phone  no questions asked  no tricky stipulations  just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the   days  the next phone i bought seems to be perfect  other than it isn’t that cheerful red  i did subtract one star because i think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale ,4
539,adorable little phone i got for my daughter  she went from an iphone   to an iphone    not really for any sort of “upgrade”  but because her   shut off on her and would not turn back on  this phone arrived in mint condition and let me clarify when i say mint  screen was untouched  not one dent or scratch in the entire body of the phone  this phone was brand new  unlocked  reset  ready to go  my daughter couldn’t believe it when she received her phone  she absolutely loves it  highly recommend this seller for true to his word details and description  this kinda stuff doesn’t happen to me  we are satisfied    ,5
540,your phones come with needing id and password and it stresses the owners to set up ,4

542,i have it now for several weeks and it’s battery life is better than i thought it would be for a used phone ,5
543,the phone functions fine but the battery came to me at    capacity which is far less than the guaranteed    in the item description  my daughter has been using it for   weeks and now the capacity is at     very disappointing   ,2
544,phone and great shape  worked just as described and had no cosmetic blemishes at all  ,5
545,i was worried about purchasing this since i saw some bad reviews  however  most of the reviews were positive so i took a chance  i’m glad i did because i only paid    for a phone that works and looks like it’s brand new  i also liked the security of it being amazon renewed so it was backed by them in case of me needing a refund  i put my sim card in and it immediately was able to take calls and texts  and my previous appleid flawlessly logged it  highly recommend,5
546,over a year later  the phone still operates good  the battery life was at     upon arrival and a year later  it’s still at     actually      i do not use fingerprint id or face recognition  so i can not speak on those features  the phone is responsive to touch and the volume is good  good refurbished buy at a good price ,4
547,i realize this is a renewed phone  but i didn t expect the battery to be left at such a low charge level   i wonder how long it s been sitting at that level   the phone looks very nice with no scratches   i ll charge it overnight and turn it on in the morning   if there s more to tell i ll come back and edit this review ,4
548,i love the iphone  ,5
549,got this phone as a replacement for my husband’s se which was initially having battery issues  bought a new battery at the apple store  and then  weeks later  quit connecting to the internet  apparently this is a known problem   he is about as far from a power user as you can possibly get but still needed a reliable phone  this fits the bill ,5
550,purchased this phone in june july and the battery is dead   this makes the   phone from this place  the first phone did not work  now this is just dead   i expected at least a good year or   of use on the battery not     months ,2
551,it didn t come in the color i ordered it in  i wanted gold but it came in black  the phone itself is fine excellent actually  it had no visible scratches or anything and the glass was fine  the battery health was    and the software was basically perfect  i like the phone a lot its just that they got the wrong color but its fine either way ,4
552,i was having some trouble with the sound fading out and i was going to return the phone just   days before the deadline to return would be up  and the seller immediately provided me with a postage paid return label   then i spent hours on the phone with comcast and apple and it was determined that the problem was not with the phone but with the cell phone service    i had started having the same problem with my android phone as i have   phones   it is a long story but before i bought this phone i bought the same phone from the same seller because i had tried to cancel it because i had failed to get the    financing and failed so i returned it ad ordered it again   had received my refund right away   so i am happy with the phone and with the seller  buyspry ,5
553,works perfect  easy to set up  in absolutely amazing shape  and can t beat the price compared to other sellers like walmart  completely as advertised  refurbished and looks absolutely brand new ,5
554,great phone  i haven’t purchased a used refurbished phone before  it’s just as good as a new one  thank you for selling a great product ,5
555,item as described  great selleriphone arrived in pristine condition  not one scratch or blemish appears brand new very happy with purchase,5
556,back camera began to shake and buzz as soon as i turned it on and tried to take photos  so i paid for a phone that doesn’t completely work,3
557,no hay fallas   está en excelente estado,5
558,although out of date  this iphone is very good for my use   it works very well and is a good value for the price ,5
559,this product was purchased by my daughter and according to her it was in really good shape to be used refurbished  i looked at the phone it came with minimal scratches    no cracks  it doesn t come with original apple packaging    but the phone is as promised and good value for price  it does come in a white box with what appears to be a new charger and the little pin to unlock sim card is underneath the inner packaging  would purchase from this store again ,4
560,n a,5
561,let me say there is nothing overtly wrong with this phone  i mean it works fine  but i got this hoping for an upgrade to my iphone      frankly  the older version is way better  so while i wouldn’t say don’t buy it  i might caution that it’s no great shakes so perhaps try a more recent one ,4
562,i had an iphone   for many years and really loved it but i started to run into storage issues and was having to clean and deleted apps  the iphone   has a much larger storage capability and still maintains all the features i am familiar with  for me it was a great buy ,5
563,                    the media could not be loaded                  cute camera totally recommend   ,5
564,i got the rose gold   gb iphone and i am honestly very impressed  i waited a month before actually buying the phone because the top reviews ive seen were negative  i am shocked with what i got  any for anyone like me wanting this phone  get it   pros  no scratches  no dents  up to date iphone  good camera  nice pocket sized  better looking irl cons  low quality packaging  i cant unlock the home button  and has trouble connecting to bluetoothit was good to me  it ll most likely be good to you   ,5
565,phone was ready to setup out of the box   we just needed to transfer the sim card and login to icloud to download apps ,4
566,i bought the renewed premium to get a better iphone   and that was money well spent  the battery life was important as i had a previous iphone   and the battery was horrible  this time the battery was at    and the initial charge went from    to    in   days  thought i admit i don t use the phone often  the fact that i did not use the phone often did not stop the previous phones from losing the charge within   hours  the phone operates very nicely and has all the options i need  the phone is in excellent condition also  i certainly recommend ,5
567,be cool,5
568,this iphone has is a replacement for my home phone and it works well  very reliable ,5
569,i purchased this unlocked iphone   to replace my daughter’s iphone    it arrived on time  in great condition and exactly as described as advertised  the maximum battery capacity  viewed in battery health setting  showed    on unboxing which is expected for a phone that’s three years old  i have two boys that both have the iphone   plus and it’s consistent with their battery health  i put my daughter’s verizon sim card in the renewed iphone   and haven’t had any issues  i would say this was a great purchase for the price  i could have got a similar deal from verizon but i like the   day purchase warranty provided by amazon ,5
570,this phone come in good condition on the outside no scratches  however when i inserted my sims card and tried to use the phone i kept getting an activation lock message  the phone is locked to the previous owner  it’s asking for their apple id and password  which i don’t have  the seller knew this because they sent a letter in the box with the phone  i have never been sent a letter with a product  i have attached photos of the letter and the phone  the name of this company is “blue chip” which does not seem legit  i looked up that name with the address it was shipped from and that business name does not come up anywhere  i would not recommend this product  in the description it states that this device is unlocked  this is not true  their phone is locked to the previous owner’s icloud account and i can’t access the phone at all  this was a christmas gift for my daughter  what a waste of money and disappointment ,1
571,muy buen telefono  lo recomiento,5
572,great phone  just like new  cheaper than paying the deductible on the verizon insurance ,5
573,i got this phone and one other for my parents for christmas  this one worked well and has good battery life for my dad who does spend a bit of time playing games  i do not believe this phone offers facial recognition but the fingerprint reader works like a new phone  happy with this one  the other was not holding a charge for more than a few hours so the vendor accepted the return and gave a quick full refund ,4
574,the phone itself looks great and works perfectly  honestly it was in better shape than i expected the battery life was really bad  it could only hold a charge for a few hours so i had to have it replaced at the apple store within just a few minutes of me leaving my original feedback  the company that sold it to me  hybrid it  called me directly and offered to pay for the battery replacement  which they did  just simply wow  in less than   minutes they called me and made it right if you want one of these phones i highly recommend you choose the vendor hybrid it for it ,5
575,purchased two rose gold iphone  ’s from the company trademore  the phones arrived in two days and in great condition  everything seems to work as it should including the cameras  speaker  microphone  and touchscreen  the battery health is above    on both phones  which is great for a used refurbished phone  there is no cosmetic damage to be noted  and all functions worked upon installing my sim card trademore sends the phones in their own packaging and includes a verizon wall pack with an   ft usb to lightning cable  inside the packaging included a flyer that ensures a   day warranty  i’m pleased with the phones and would buy from this company again ,5
576,my daughter’s renewed phone had weirdly washed out colors with a blue tint to the screen  found out that cheap third party after market screen replacements are  unsurprisingly  not nearly as good apple’s original screens  and you can find out which yours is if under display   brightness there’s a toggle for true tone  sure enough  no true tone option on her new phone  my eyes are too used to the vibrant screens to be comfortable with the weird ones  but they accepted my return without problem  bought a renewed one from a different company on amazon  and this one had true tone  if this is something that’s going to bother you  beware  photo  phone on the left is true tone  phone on the right is the renewed one we returned ,3
577,have gotten   refurbished ones from amazon and both have worked great  the battery life seems a little short but it’s an older phone and to be expected i’m about   months into number   now and over a year with the first  both iphone  ,5
578,this phone asked for a passcode when i turned it on   then when i booted with my sim  which gave it a data connection  a few minutes later th find my phone alarm went off  the phone kept saying “iphone disabled  try again in   minutes” which means some tried the wrong passcode lots of times before sending it to me   i’m addition to ringing the alarm  the owner should activate the lost feature which enables them to post a message on the lock screen with their contact info   they didn’t so i returned it to amazon   i was even getting live messages from a social game    there is no clearer evidence of a stolen phone than this   how in the world can amazon do this ,1
579,the camera will always make a shutter sound  even when on silent  which leads me to believe it was refurbished from japan  it constantly overheats and there are plenty of issues with it s speed  although i m sure that s because of the deteriorating battery health  i purchased the phone in   so i wouldn t be surprised if it needed a new battery by now  all in all a decent phone that gets the job done  and although it is frustrating at times  it still works ,5
580,overall  this phone has been exactly what i expected   everything functions well   the only reason i gave it   stars is that the screen had a few minor scratches  and the battery maximum capacity only reaches      i know these are all things within the expectations of a refurbished phone  but for the hundreds of dollars i spent  it s still a little disappointing hence   stars not     overall  though  i m very satisfied ,4
581,loved it,5
582,i ve had a great experience purchasing from this seller  i had to return the phone because of some rear camera issues  but the seller was fully cooperative and very helpful  therefore  although i had to spend time on the setting up of the phone  and the subsequent erasure of my data   the stress was mitigated by the responsiveness of the seller and their willingness to replace the item with a fully satisfying phone  i ll definitely work with the seller again  i am assured that if there s anything wrong with the phone  the seller will make sure to replace it with an item that is satisfactory and without any defect ,5
583,it will be good but the camera was super burry and you couldn’t  see nothing and it was bad but every thing else work wonders i was using it about a week untili had to use the camera and i show it was burry and i was like it probably dirty then i clean it and nothing it probably the case i took it off and nothing  i thought it because i was trying to take a picture of my laptop of a information but then i took a picture of a paper and it was also bad  every thing else works good  ,4
584,fingerprint is spot on  everything is perfect accept messages i get from alternate sexual persons ,3
585,prior to purchase  the publication specifically stated that the phone battery was no lower than     upon receiving the phone  in the battery health   charging section  it was stated that the  battery s health is significantly degraded and the maximum capacity was     this is really deceiving  i saw the same    comment about other phones as well on amazon  amazon has become too much of a profit making business  making false statements about the quality of products it sells  but really  is typical of american profit making schemes at consumers  costs and confidence  the qa   qc diligence process is non existent in my opinion ,1
586,its a good deal if u know what you buying,5
587,the phone says product under the iphone logo,3
588,worked for about a month then the screen went black with vertical lines  i understand they can’t find all the bugs when refurbishing these phones  my problem is that we couldn’t send it in for repair or exchange  we had to send it back to amazon then wait for a refund and then try to find another one at the same price  the whole process is longer than if we sent it in to get the screen replaced  when a company says they have a warranty i expect them to fix the problem or replace the item  not make me take an item back to the store for a refund we did buy the extra accident coverage here on amazon  we used it the last time my son bought a phone and it was an easy process  file a claim online  answer a couple questions sent by email  return the phone and get an amazon credit the day ups scans the label  i was afraid my son wouldn’t get his money back since they prorate canceled plans  which makes sense  thankfully amazon sent them a message and they were kind enough to refund the whole amount so my son won’t be out any money when he orders a new phone and plan  he mowed lawns to save up for this phone so this is a big bummer for him  although it’s a good lesson in patients ,1
589,everything was perfect except for the fact the camera was completely unusable  good battery life  from the   hours i even had the phone   it was snappy and installed    apps with ease  would ve been   stars if it wasn t for the awful camera  seller s fault for bad quality control ,3
590,i had no problems  everything worked perfectly ,4
591,everything work normally  good price for excellent produc ,4
592,i got my iphone    fully unlocked and excellent battery capacity,5
593,didn’t use face recon   battery seems weak ,5
594,bought this for a christmas gift as my nieces phone died  she had an iphone    this phone is great it just was smaller than expected  ,4
595,battery life does not last at all  have to charge multiple times a day ,3
596,would be great if it took better pix,3
597,great phone  pay for the premium unlocked  i did and the phone works perfectly  the battery is     i’ve had no issues thus far  i’ve had other renewed phones  this one is just as good if not better than the others  i do wish they had an option for fasting shipping  but it did arrive before the expected date ,5
598,just using it for a home phone and internet access when on vacation ,4
599,bien,4
600,very happy with my purchase  i just “upgraded” from my refurbished   unlocked iphone      and this phone is a great value for the money  i could not justify shelling out more than      for a phone  so after researching i settled on the iphone     in gold   i shopped around  and decided to purchase on amazon because of  the amazon renewed policy  as well as the ability to purchase   year accident protection  my phone arrived with a few very light scratches on the screen  as described   which doesn’t bother me one bit as i always add a glass screen protector  the speed and functionality are also perfect  and setup was easy   the battery life is not as great as expected  but not enough of an issue to decrease the rating  i purchased from breed  highly recommend ,5
601,this is the second refurbished phone i’ve bought  this one is very good  great condition  it has a few very tiny scratches on the sides  which is why it didn’t get a     but once i put a phone cover on it  they aren’t that noticeable  battery life is great  keyboard and microphone great  had no trouble transferring my information over  great condition over all  very happy with phone for the price ,4
602,volume broken  features not turned on but working anyway…,2
603,the phone functions well and appears to be in  very good  condition  the one downside is that the battery sits at    capacity so it is going to have to be replaced in the near future ,4
604,we bought this for our son and it works perfectly   thank you ,5
605,i found it hard to believe that this phone would be    worth it because it is refurbished  but after a couple of weeks of having this phone  it proved to be as efficient as it claims  i had a rough beginning with the phone but the company was so understanding and fixed my problem  the phone was in great condition when i received it  it was working just like a brand new phone would  the only problem is the battery life  personally  the phone has great qualities but the battery life is not one   overall i m happy with my purchase  you definitely get what you pay for ,4
606,i can honestly say i’m very satisfied with my purchase it was better than i thought it was ,5
607,i was honestly scared because of the bad reviews but when it came  it was honestly in good condition  came a day early  has a couple of scuffs in each corner but no cracks in the glass  i d honestly recommend to get it but it s up to you if you wanna risk getting a good one or a bad one  i d still give it   stars because of the scuffs though and also if you do decide to buy it  make sure you check the imei to see if it s a lost or stolen phone ,4
608,i read many other bad reviews but mostly because of the seller they got them from i heard the phones not being unlocked or in a certain case   blacklisted and some just down right complained about features they didn’t include such as headphones  which was in the description not included  mines came in this generic normal box and had like   very small scratches very unnoticeable til i looked hard while i cleaned my finger prints off the phone but i tested the for carrier lock or black list and the phone was in great condition unlocked as advertised    battery this phone almost looked brand new just be cautious of your sellers because when u chose a phone different options of sellers provide your choice as well but other than that i rate  felt like i got a great deal for a great price very satisfied,5
609,it s been almost a month now and i ve had no problems with it  looks brand new  came with charger  refurbished but i can t tell  it s brand new to me  great buy     unlocked phone ,5
610,liked that i am able to help him with contacts etcit fits his limited needs ,5
611,must say phone is in great working condition can t complain thanks,5
612,iphone is my third or fourth iphone   previous phones worked until they simply quit this phone requires sim card which the online videos plainly show how to install   unfortunately  amazon web site did not mention that a sim card and phoneservice was required for phone to work   so i spent labor day weekend withouta working phone   shame on amazon for not mentioning this   if i had known could have had sim card home waiting for iphone to arrive and iphone did arriveon time ,4
613,                    the media could not be loaded                  i  use this phone for everything so school work personal life although i used to have two phones one was for work and the second one was for my personal life but now i basically just use one phone  so    yes i use this phone for everything i love thee facial  recognition too  pretty cool  and the fingerprinting i like that too   that’s some thing that reminds me of  those james bond movies lol  so yeah    great product ,5
614,the first one we received came with a shattered screen  within an hour of submitting my complaint  the seller contacted me by the next day had shipped the new device out  i informed him that my daughters birthday was in a couple days and i was expecting to have this before her birthday  he expedited the shipping and covered the cost plus refunded me a couple dollars for the inconvenience  it was a great experience from this seller  i should have left review sooner but i forgot ,5
615,                    the media could not be loaded                  bought this for my   yr old son and we haven’t had any problems  based off of the reviews phone came in great condition looking brand new   was easy to get activated and battery health was    ,5
616,my daughter   old love her phone  ,5
617,amazing    i’ve had my phone for a little under a month now and i love it  for such a small price it is definitely worth it  for those of you scared of buying used things  if you’re not satisfied you can return it  my phone came   days early and it activated perfectlyat first my texts kept sending to my old phone but i believe that’s my carriers fault regardless  i do not regret this at all    ,4
618,it is what i expected   an iphone   nothing beats an iphone  ,5
619,my husband loves this phone,5
620,great phone and great customer service  thank you ,5
621,first time buying a refurb phone  daughter needed a replacement for her old one that looked as if someone had taken a sledge hammer to it  how does a phone get like that  works great  delivered with a good battery  it was at or very near    life  no dings or scratches  with   of storage i will never hear again about running out of storage  came with used protective glass installed which had a few chips in the corner but no big deal  have not got to it yet  but easily replaced  also bought a silicome cover and replacement glass    months  so far  so good  could have saved an extra    if i had waited until after the christmas season ,5
622,i am really blown away by this purchase  it arrived three days early  in pristine condition   i work remotely  so having a device that cooperates is essential   the sound quality is out of this world  with the storage capacity of   i am off the walls happy      i am the director of a public high school and am on my phone constantly   the speed and again storage is unbelievable   i would recommend looking into the seller of the various negative comments that were left in order to tease out who to purchase from   this device was sold through kiss electronics   you ll see they have overwhelmingly positive reviews   happy to answer any questions   couldn t be happier             ,5
623,battery not  holding charge as much as it should,3
624,phone was in near perfect condition  packaging was basic  but that’s a good thing   less waste than original apple packaging  popped in sim card from old verizon phone  turned on  and booyah   worked perfectly  my daughter has been using for over a month now and no issues at all i will probably be buying a lot of phones for the family in the future through a refurbished seller like this shipping was a bit slow  and the tracking didn’t update until it was literally in the mailbox  but that’s probably due to the christmas rush   still received it in time for christmas morning  so no complaints ,5
625,battery dies too fast,3
626,front camera stopped working after   months,3
627,i picked up the phone to replace my wife’s iphone    prior to buying an iphone   through this method i read through a bunch of reviews  i admit that i was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device  i took the chance and bought it  the device was in really good shape  these phones are all glass  there wasn’t a scratch on the thing  it is pristine  my own   has been in cases the entire time i’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the   i purchased here  there are zero signs of wear on the lightning port   battery was at    health  i updated it to ios    it had    the phone looks and runs as if it were brand new   i can safely recommend this product and seller ,5
628,i dropped my old iphone   after     years of faithful service   i like to save money  so i always buy older models of phones  typically refurbished trade ins   i am very pleased with this iphone     i ve had it for about a week   it arrived on time  was fully unlocked as promised  looks brand new  and all functionality works perfectly   i will definitely purchase another refurbished phone from the seller when the time comes   thanks ,5
629,the phone worked well for a few months  i bought this for my   year old son since he rides the bus  after less than   months  the battery wasn’t holding a charge well and slowly got worse  at   days  the battery started to swell and lift the screen  i contacted the seller  not asking for a refund but simply wanting a new battery since the current one was swelling and could explode  and he basically told me i was out of luck because i was   days past the   day warranty  two days    it was thanksgiving the week prior and i didn’t write him on thanksgiving so basically he told me i was out of warranty period and offered no help  how terrible would it have been if the battery had exploded while in possession of my   year old son  this seller doesn’t care  only wanted to keep reminding me it had been   days and warranty was for only   days  terrible  i’m glad it didn’t explode  buyer beware ,1
630,looks like it s been through many owners  harder to use than my samsung,3
631,bought to replace my   which was reaching end of memory and battery life   this one will fit that need very nicely   looks and feels new   battery is very strong   memory is more than sufficient for me fast shipping and packaged safely just what i was looking for in a phone ,5
632,i order iphone   as my primary phone broke and meanwhile i needed a phone to get by my day to day activities  this was my first ever encounter with buying a renewed phone and i was skeptical at first but i was pleasantly surprised the phone came in a generic box with a iphone compatible generic charger  which was what i expected but seller went ahead and send a cover for the same  which was kind of great coming to the phone itself  there were no scratches  cracks  or dent whatsoever with the phone  had it been delivered in a genuine apple box i couldn’t have distinguished it from brand new phone  battery life seems to be great  every seems to be working great  will definitely add more once i’ve used it for a while  total bang for the bucks ,5
633,phone is working as advertised  except that the lightning charging plug should have been changed when it was refurbished  i’m having problems getting my new phone to charge  i can tell that the lightning plug is worn and that it really doesn’t grip my lightning plugs as tight as it should ,4
634,nice product   no scratches at all   the only problem i have was the cell phone was making noise in the box   it should have been secured to prevent from knocking the box during shipping   beside that all is well   thank god the phone is fine  that is why i gave   stars instead of   ,4
635,if you don’t want to pay through the nose for a new phone  this is a seriously good option that will tide you over  i’ve had mine for a couple of years and other than the battery life decreasing  which every phone does  i am so happy with this purchase  transferring data from an old iphone to this new to me iphone was easy peezy  i would recommend purchasing a refurbished phone ,5
636,we were not able to get it to work  would freeze on software upload  we gave up after   hours of trying  returning it and ordered a different iphone from another vendor  awaiting it s arrival ,2
637,i bought this phone for my   year old for his first phone  it does everything my brand new one did  works pretty much like brand new  no sim card but it did come with the sim card tool so you can install one yourself  also came with a charger cord and the wall brick to plug it in  very nice  no scratches ,5
638,update i ordered the same phone from hybrid it which ive bought from before so i knew this would be better  of course it was the best experience  hybrid it is the best renwed seller to work with   previous post for loop mobile i learned my lesson  only buy refurb products from a reputable third party on amazon renewed  the phone came with a passcode so i had to send it back  i ordered this same phone from a previous seller i trust from amazon and of course it came passcode free like a new phone would be  loop mobile please do better ,5
639,i received the phone  and added my icloud info and sign in  then  the latest ios download  downloaded automatically  since then the touchscreen no longer works  now i need to return phone  but  all my info and apple pay are on this  and i can’t get into the phone to reset ,4
640,transferred data  nice overall  just what she wanted    thanks,5
641,problems with hearing when someone called right away  thought it was my husbands poor hearing  finally took it to a cell phone repair and they said the  earpiece  where you hear was so dirty he was surprised i could hear at all  it also had some other issues  would not recommend a refurbished phone ever  it seems like it should have been taken apart and these issues would have been noticed  i emailed the seller and they pretty much told me too bad ,1
642,works great  came unlocked and i had no problem with setup,5
643,the charger that came with it stopped working on the   day   other than that   phone works as advertised  thank you ,4
644,received on time  setup fast  works perfectly  added a sim card with no problem,5
645,visually  the phone is in great condition however  the battery life was not such  i remember it died almost as quick as my   year old shattered  oil logged  dusty iphone       battery life,2
646,a nice iphone with really good features and affordable  the only problem it’s some scratches on the phone and the battery health because it’s not a brand new phone  in my case i don’t have a lot of scratches but i have    of battery health  the seller that provide me with gifts  a case and a ceramic screen protector i love this iphone  it’s similar at the one i had before and have more storage than before for a lot less money  if you want a great iphone or you are new to this  you can buy an iphone se   but if you know what’s best for you  i highly recommend this one,5
647,this was a great price for a used phone without having to  get her the newest and latest phone  more importantly  she loves the older phone better than a new iphone   ,4
648,refurbished from seller iblueberry in exactly like new condition  good battery  camera  performance  no scratches or screen problems,5
649,item too small ,3
650,the phone arrived in good condition  there is a small inner crack but i barely notice it  everything works well and for the price i am happy  it was easy enough to set up  i will update if anything changes  the battery charges fast  it was at    when it came and after   minutes of charging it was almost full  looking forward to using this phone more ,4
651,i don’t use face recognition  i ordered this phone because i needed a newer phone ,5
652,the phone arrived with a small scratch in the top corner of the screen but hard to see at first glance  we had no issues connecting the phone to our carrier  and functionally the phone is doing good so far  also the battery health was at     i was skeptical  but i was pleasantly surprised ,4
653,the phone came as promised  externally it looked good  and after updating the software it accepted my sim card with no problems  the screen protected it came with cracked within the first day of use  the battery had a maximum capacity of     which was expected  however  the phone does discharge when being used very quickly  it can go from full to empty in only   hours  very good quality for the price  except for the battery life ,4
654,not sure the previous condition of this phone being it’s refurbished  but it’s only lasted a month ,2
655,replacing a very grumpy android phone  about time my  other half  is introduced to the world of iphone  haha  phone showed up in the amazon packaging with off brand cord and plugin like it was supposed to  no scratches or dings that i could find and it came right on  seems to hold charge perfectly fine as well only complaint is user fault and not the phone  issues figuring out how to use it haha update october     won t charge anymore under most circumstances  has to sit on a flat surface and even then you have to situate the cable just right and if you jostle it it stops charging without even telling you  can t afford a new phone but need a phone for work   ,3
656,my hubby loves it  he likes it better than his old iphone   ,5
657,so far the iphone works great  no issue so far,4
658,phone looks and works like a new phone  my only complaint is the battery  health came at     apple recommends battery replacement at      these refurbish companies should simply install new batteries and charge    more than it would be a   star deal and be a as new phone ,4
659,i had to replace the included charging cable after only a few uses  as it stopped charging the phone  the phone itself was in good condition and had a better than advertised battery life  i swapped out the charging cable and so far all appears to be working  will live with the phone a little longer and provide an update around the   day mark ,4
660,phone was “renewed” but arrived looking brand new and with    battery capacity  sadly  it has not turned out to be a good buy  shortly after the return window closed  the phone began having audio and messenger issues  i am now only able to talk in short intervals of     minutes before the outgoing voice capability drops  i can still hear the person on my phone but they cannot hear me  a quick redial and all is ok again but only for a short time  first few times it happened  i could shutdown phone  power up and the problem would disappear for a few days  not so any longer  comes back as quickly as first call after power up  haven’t been able to discern a pattern for length of call  seems to randomly go out  sometimes it will last   minutes  sometimes   seconds  imessage also randomly converts to sms  quick restart seems to correct that issue but phone doesn’t seem to recover imessage function without restart once it drops  everything else seems to  at least right now  work as it should  tired of dealing with it so i am back in the market for a new iphone ,2
661,i read a lot of reviewing saying the phone wasn’t unlocked  however it’s sim unlocked  when you go to activate it purchase the straight talk plan  i got this for my daughter   it’s perfect  the straight talks package was    unlimited   it came with   sim cards  one for verizon  at t    t mobile  you have to see which one was compatible with the iphone  we tried verizon   it wouldn’t work then i tried t mobile   it works perfectly fine ,5
662,dads iphone   quit charging  this phone battery goes days before running down  love it ,5
663,as the title says  works as well as the iphone    replaced it because i thought a problem was hardware related  turned out it wasn’t   do like the expanded   gb memory over the   gb memory of the   because i can have my entire music library onboard  use music  podcasts  calendar  all of it  signing in to my account  the phone filled with all my apps and data  honestly don’t notice it’s much faster with updated chip and i seldom use the camera  so newer features don’t make a significant difference to me but bottom line is is works as well as i’m used to  will use it until i upgrade to iphone   when that comes out  so i can be ready for   when it really it deployed and working  most places have little to no    regardless of what the ads say  ,5
664,i was skeptical again ordering renewed smartphones off amazon   but this time i tried the new premium renewed iphone   unlocked gold   the phone was perfect  not a flaw anywhere on the device  came with a new shark charger and cable   everything works perfect and battery health and performance is as promised   i ve been using it daily for almost   months  comes with a one year    satisfaction warranty   hope amazon keeps adding more phones to their premium line  seems they are batter than the regular renewed phones ,5
665,i couldn t be more pleased with this purchase  there are no imperfections on the outside   works beautifully so far ,5
666,great phone   packaging  and comes with a charger  thank you ,5
667,well i’m aware this is a refurbished phone so i can’t expect it to be a great device  the battery life is     a little scratch on the display and the only thing i dislike is that the true tone is damaged not available  apparently this device display has been fixed before but the true tone remained damaged ,4
668,i got the iphone   space gray   and it works perfectly  it was exactly what i ordered  i just got it today so if anything changes i will update my review,5
669,i got an   refurbished tmobile metropcs unlocked   it is beautiful not a scratch     full battery capacity charge  i asked the seller to  help me figure out if tmobile metropcs unlocked would be ok  the seller exceeded expectations   phenomenal customer service quick response and it works great  switched the sim card and i am happy ,5
670,i bought it for my son   really happy with this purchase  at first  i was a little skeptical about it  due to it is not a brand new phone  but i wanted to give it a try  the set up and transfer all iphone data was easy  no issues   my son is very happy  he doesn’t like big devices  so  this is perfect for him for a fraction of a retailer’s price  i totally recommend amazon renewed store,5
671,so far it is okay   for the price  and it is small,3
672,                    the media could not be loaded                  this was suppose to be a gift for my son and it won’t hold a charge at all  it can be on    and time it is touched it turns off and when you try to turn it back on it seems as if it’s dead when it’s not  that happened when we first got it now it doesn’t even come on it just shows the apple symbol and shuts right off it’s so frustrating because i’ve never had a problem while shopping from amazon,1
673,this is the second refurbished iphone that i purchased from hybrid it on amazon  i purchased from hybrid it because of their excellent customer satisfaction rating  i bought the iphone   as a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she loved it  the phone arrived on time  was well packaged and in perfect condition  it looked like new  not a scratch on it  it worked perfectly and when the sim card was added  was set up on a cell phone plan with no issues  the battery health was    which is great for a refurbished phone ,5
674,i ordered this phone and it did not come with a charger but i had my old one that i used to get it up and running   however when i tried to set the phone up and log into my apple account to transfer my stuff over i could not do so kept getting error message   the only way to use the phone would be to start fresh without all of my stuff from my old phone  so i m returning the phone ,2
675,i bought this phone to replace my grandmas iphone she had  it came in a bland cardboard box with the phone in bubble wrap and the charging cable and charging wall plug wrapped up nicely but everything could shift around a lot in the box but luckily everything was safe and nothing broken  the batter life of the phone was at    meaning that was the max life of the battery so not too bad but a little low for my liking  decent price  decent phone ,4
676,i have purchased   iphone   from the seller hybrid it  finger print readers are good  no problems there  i have no complaints  i first bought one for my daughter last year  i then purchased   more for my other daughters  finally i purchased another for my mother in law  they arrived on time and i had no problems activating them with metropcs  the phones cosmetic appearances are great  i’ve had no problems with these phones   both phones battery health was at     i have only purchased from the seller hybrid it ,5
677,i received the phone an iphone   for my wife and was simply amazed at the condition   this phone does not appear as ever been uses   it is in new pristine condition   operates beautifully as it should   it is everything and more that the seller described  thank you so much for a great product and keep up the wonderful work  ,5
678,i am very satisfied with this product  it looks the same as the picture and works perfectly as expected  if you are thinking of buying it  i recommend you take it ,5
679,thank you for this phone  i ordered   phones for my twin daughters who live in belton  tx  i ordered this red iphone   from your company and it came in excellent working order  i ordered a space gray iphone   from another company  i am still trying to figure out how to help my   year old daughter return the faulty phone from other company  now thanks to you my daughters at least have   working phone  i hope i can return the faulty phone and order another phone from you ,5
680,works great and looks new,5
681,the phone was beyond my expectations and i love it so much  i was a little hesitant with the idea of it being refurbished but it hasn’t let me down so far one important thing to note  apparently phones that are sold to created in chinese and other markets have a feature on the phone where it’s actually illegal to not have the shutter sound go off when you take a picture  this is the case with this phone    it’s not the end of the world for me but it can be a bit obnoxious and definitely not discreet  that’s the only downside  if anyone knows a solution please let me know   ,5
682,i have bought several refurbished phones from ebay over the years  this phone from amazon has far surpassed any of those purchases   battery life is typical for any cell phone   new or used   this one recharges quickly though  similar to my   so transitioning was easy but the   is giving me better sound  pictures and cell coverage   i immediately placed a screen cover on it and put it in a wallet case  so it has tolerated being dropped a few times and is still intact   the price is a decent bargain also  i would definitely recommend it ,4
683,phone itself works pretty well  i love the large storage  sometimes the phone does lag when changing from the phone’s home page to other apps and it’s can’t be the internet i don’t think  also this phone does not have a built in phone jack which is annoying but i think that’s what’s on the tin  all in all ,4
684,this phone looks brand new  it works great i was worried because i have att and i know it has to be a certain one to work on their network  it came early and works and looks great ,5
685,server errors  i couldn t remove my info from the phone  i couldn t connect most of the time  the battery drained  without use  in a could of hours  but the seller offered to replace at no charge   i had already returned at my own expense  ,2
686,ordered an iphone   w     the phone arrived in a matter of days   when received it was in excellent condition with no cracks  scratches or any marks at all   battery life is as expected   purchased from amazon due to their   day refund policy if there were any issues with the phone   i hope to have this one for years like the one it replaced   totally satisfied ,5
687,all good except battery does not last very long,4
688,received one day later than what expected  the package was left in the middle of the sidewalk in a florida afternoon storm  i m not sure if the wind shifted but when i found it  it was in soaking wet in the middle of the sidewalk of my front door scared that it got damaged i opened immediately  thank god it was ok  the battery charge was about    so i started charging it and proceed with the set up  at first it didn t work  but i read the included instructions supplied by the seller and voila  it worked  the phone looks like new  no scratches  all functions working properly  satisfied so far ,5
689,it’s a good phone for an iphone   but the battery life is low  i have an iphone    that has low battery life  that’s why i got the iphone   but it’s battery life is less than my other phone that i’ve had   years or more,3
690,thank you,5
691,worked ok but not great  probably will just spend the money to get a brand new phone next time,3
692,this renewed premium phone was perfect  i actually bought     one quite literally looked like it had never even been used  not one scratch or ding   battery capacity     fantastic  the other one had one tiny little ding that i really wouldn t have seen if i wasn t searching hard  and    battery capacity  both function perfectly  came with a charger and a mfi certified cord  i m so happy i found these amazon backed used phones  it took all of the risk out of the transaction and i couldn t be happier with the result  buying my teens used phones on amazon from now on ,5
693,it’s fully functional and works just fine  i use straight talk and i haven’t really had any problems except at some point when i took calls i couldn’t hear them unless i put it on speaker but it went away and work just fine  came with a tiny scratch on the bottom corner but i have a case on so i don’t see it  same size as an iphone   but the iphone   has a louder earphone  i can hear through it but it’s not loud so that sucks but my phone works and it’s really nice  came with a charger too  no earbuds unfortunately,4
694,it is a good phone it works perfectly  it’s better then iphone   that i had  battery life is longer ,5
695,this iphone is awesome  practically brand new  so happy i got this phone  keep up the great service ,5
696,i got this phone and everything was perfect  no cracks and everything worked  except for the sim card slotmetro couldn’t help me either  after a week going to return it and took my sim out and placed it back in  some how it’s all fineone star less for the scare,4
697,working perfectly  glad i decided to get this cellphone ,5
698,phone came in perfect physical condition  no scratches  looks brand new  did take a bit to get it set up as the phone didn’t come with the newest software and it wouldn’t restore from the backup on my old phone without a software update  battery life says it’s at    capacity but so far it has been great  well worth the price ,4
699,it’s a great phone   works great,4
700,me llegó como un teléfono nuevo y funciona bien y le dura mucho la carga,5
701,phone arrived quickly in a box with a charger as indicated in the description  was not able to activate my phone via they never as usual  had to cash my carrier and they did a few things behind the scenes and eventually was able to get it activated using my previous sim card  the issue however is the erratic battery life  sometimes it drains slowly and sometimes there are drops of      over a ten minute span while the phone is idle  the image shows that the battery needs servicing  waiting to hear back from seller now about a replacement ,2
702,nice phone just not compatible with sprint,3
703,this phone was in like new condition  no scratches or blemishes at all  in great working order with long battery life  will buy from this seller again  ,5
704,has bare minimum    battery  other than that super pleased  screen perfect  very minor scuffs on the back  one tiny chip on the frame  nice packaging  i use it as a music player so the battery is fine and i can always get it replaced  i paid    which was a great price  highly recommend ,4
705,so far so good   i was able to use bluetooth to transfer everything from my old phone  which was unexpected and wonderful   condition of phone is great and everything works as it should   the battery does seem to drop faster than it should  but it s totally manageable as long as i plug it in at some point during the day and overnight   all in all  very happy ,5
706,what a good buy this was an economical solution for my son the battery life wasn t great when we got it  but a software update fixed that the phone itself was in very good condition  with almost no blemishes he is very happy with it — and so am i  i saved a chunk of cash  i ll definitely buy refurbished again ,5
707,hi i think the original owner lock my phone i bought from amazon i think one of you guys need  unlock my phone back it say iphone is disabledi try my password and fingerprint still not working iphone is disabledwhen i bought it say factory unlocked,4
708,el teléfono en general está bien y a pesar que el tema de si era compatible o no estaba confuso  se conectó perfectamentelo único que no puedo usar mi cámara porque tiembla  no puedo regresarlo de panama a eu porque tendría que pagar la devolución  solo es gratis desde y hasta mi casillero en miami,3
709,phone doesn’t come with facial recognition  battery life isn’t the best and definitely not like a new phone  have to put in password more than i used to due to the fingerprint scanner not working all the time  overall a good working phone tho worth   stars,4
710,i was mostly surprised with how quick  responsive this phone was despite it being relatively old  as far as computer electronics are concerned  i got the amazon certified renewed phone  didn t have any problems with sound quality  my screen was in great condition   no cracks  came with a protector on it  phone worked great  i returned it within   days as i changed my mind dropping    on this but it was pretty nice  and not a bad experience with amazon certified refurbished at all ,5
711,it was like new  everything works  my grandaughter was thrilled with it ,5
712,i wanted to upgrade my son from the first iphone se  the activation was simple just popped his sim card in and it immediately started working  the battery life is to be expected with the older iphone model  i have no complaints  this has been the perfect gift for my son,5
713,i have to say i have only had the phone for   hours  but i was truly surprised when the phone came  it was perfect  the phone works and looks like new  i couldn’t be happier ,5
714,the product was really in a great condition like new one ,5
715,first time iphone buyer and user  good product  worked coming out of the box  quick and easy setup  good battery life  could use a little cleaning but overall still good in great condition  if you re going for a cheaper option then the latest generation of iphone  i would say this would be a great buy ,4
716,it was hard to get my carrier to turn on my phone completely  consumer cellular just kept saying “ we don’t guarantee that these phones are compatible with our system”  they specifically did not turn on the universal setting  i lost work time and money and could not get my mail for a week  suggestions when purchasing look at the fine line and make sure your carrier tak s the phone  ultimately consumer cellular  at t and t mobile lines  we’re trying to get me to purchase their own phone  one week later went to apple store and about two hours later my phone was operational  completelyi do want to purchase the insurance before the   warranty ends ,4
717,i bought this for my husband because he desperately needed a new phone  my opinion not his   he was using my old   and was constantly dropping calls   he insisted that the old phone was fine and that he would not spend    on a new one  this refurbished   is a solid phone  and because it is a renewed premium  it has a full year warranty  granted  my husband doesn t use it for much more than calls and texts  but he is very happy with it and is amazed at how long it holds a charge ,5
718,received the phone today  it looks new  shiny  pretty and red   i went and got a sim card from walmart came home and set it up in about   minutes and it’s been good since  no complaints and the battery life is    ,4
719,hot too much,2
720,purchased the phone for long last battery come to find out the batteries defective so i would recommend not purchasing this particular item  so i had to replace the battery in and causing me    to replace the battery so now the phone works somewhat better but i had issues with this phone from the day  i got it to this day i understand that they’re selling these items but unfortunately  i don’t think this item should be sell on amazon ever again from this particular third party person or people’s ,1
721,the phone is in good condition  i had it checked out at a best buy  the battery life is at     so i will need to have it replaced eventually  the screen did have some scratches but they added a screen protector to the front  not bad for a refurbished phone  operating system in good condition  no bugs ,4
722,since i was replacing my iphone   with this    i was already very familliar   the new phone didn t rock my world  and i didn t expect it too  that is not what this purchase was about  this new phone came to replace about the exact phone and it did exactly that  painless transfer of contacts  photos and apps and being able to go to the office the next day with a new phone ready with no hiccups  good purchase ,5
723,after several months i can’t hear the phone unless it’s on speaker  this is not a problem with the audio on apps or online  tried many things but i’ve given up  would like to reduce my rating by one star ,4
724,muy bueno y llego a tiempo ,5
725,i bought the silver iphone   used here through amazon  and everything works great on the phone  i haven’t had any issues using my carrier  sound playing  or otherwise  works as intended which is the important part however  the back screen was clearly replaced and done so with little care  there’s a  lip on one side  so the glass back isn’t flush as it should be  not pivotal to the function of the phone itself  but still annoying edit  after a month or so of owning the phone  it starting having issues  ultimately i sent the phone back to the seller and received a refund  still     for easy return without issue ,4
726,bought this amazon renewed  and it worked perfectly and still looked like new  unfortunately after using it for about   days  i realized i would need to move up to the   plus   i ve used nexus and pixel devices for the last   years  and never realized how small the iphone is seller was super easy to deal with  no hassle return  and if they had an   plus i definitely would have bought it from them ,4
727,i like this  but i think i should have gone with the   plus  this thing is tiny in my hand   one thing i m not a fan of is that apple seems to have taken away the ability to make my own custom ringtones for the thing   it s one of two things that makes me keep thinking of going to android  but i have bought so much music  tv shows  and movies on itunes  that the idea of doing it is a bit daunting ,4
728,i bought this phone for my son to upgrade for college  he was having a lot of problems with the service at our house  the phone kept dropping service thus no phone calls  i called  the carrier  one of the top      they went through software and could not find an issue other than service in the area  i called techdealerus and they immediately sent a replacement  it turned out it was not the phone it was the service  i switched carriers and the original phone is working fine  i have sent back the replacement still in the packaging  top notch service from these guys  i will definitely use again ,5
729,after reading all of the reviews  i was seriously scared that i would end up with a defective phone  but so far so good  came in great condition  charges fast and hold the battery well  only thing i can’t comment on  that others have complained about  is finding a service provider  i bought this phone for my daughter  for her minecraft  games  zoom and discord  and since it runs great on wifi  we have no need to actually get a phone plan,5
730,for starters  i am not a gadget girl  but i needed a new iphone  that could handle the latest ios update  so i can use my banking app   this phone is absolutely perfect  i love the size  the color  the price and the set up was a breeze  i can’t believe this iphone refurbished  it is in immaculate condition and it arrived earlier than i expected—even after i incorrectly entered my delivery address  i emailed the team at greentech and they jumped right in and assisted me with successfully rerouting my package  outstanding product  outstanding service    stars  ,5
731,my son and i purchased   phones   the phones do indeed work  but some things we re not thrilled with   the battery of one phone doesn t charge to      that s a bit of a bummer as refurbished should indeed charge to the full      we also confirmed that these are international phones where certain functional aspects of iphones of the united states don t work   that was another disappointment   not sure i would have purchased if i realized what features would not work   example   you can t turn off or even lower the camera shutter sound when taking pictures ,4
732,is a really good phone  the only thing is the battery and for some reason the keyboard vibration doesn’t work  i don’t know yet if i will return the device because it says that this phone is almost in the   cycle  so     also i did not receive the sim card key  but that’s ok  ,4
733,phone came in impeccable condition  as of now i have no complaints  everything seem to be working   cameras  mics  buttons  speakers  will update if anything changes   update  phone is absolutely amazing i haven’t experienced not a single issue  if i could give a grade on my new phone i’d give it an a          a second phone for my bf  all i can say is so far so mf good  visibly the phone is in nearly perfect condition  i haven’t experienced any software issues so far  battery capacity is at    the phone is fully unlocked  no sim restrictions  cameras and buttons all perfect…so far  will do a   week update on this one too ,5
734,perfecto  pero no le servia la camara,3
735,i was worried it might not be that great bc it was refurbished but it s doing great  battery has held up well and the phone has good storage  shipping got complicated but the seller was v helpful   helped me find it at the post office and all was well ,5
736,the phone came quicker than expected  the delivery was on point  i was actually nervous about buying the phone but it is better than i expected  the only defect on the phone was a small prick where the sim card is place  it looked as though someone used something else to try and open it  as for the battery  it last for a full day because i work with my phone and always in the wifi zone  otherwise  i think it’s safe to say good buy      i’ve had it for almost one month now ,4
737,i bought this phone in may    everything was working perfect until about october november of this year when it would stop holding the charge for a simple thing like listening to a voicemail   it would make the charge go down   … i decided to check the battery health and it says it is severely degraded   i don’t know how long it was this way  i should have checked right away but now a little over   months after purchase i have to get a new phone  ,3
738,nice phone  works as expected except for terrible reception  i can be sitting next to a friend with the same carrier but a different iphone and they have bars and i have none  stay away from iphone   s   ,4
739,phone itself is great the battery is shot  when they say the phones are required to have an    or better battery life  expect to get    battery life have to charge phone multiple times a day ,2
740,i love that amazon  or whoever they sub this out to  gave a warranty  that was one of the main reasons i purchased   plus cost was cheaper than best buy   not sure if this has to do w the phone  but my email is slow to load   i also dont like the fact that i cant plug normal headset in without adapter  but that is apples issue   overall the phone was a good decision to purchase and i have no problems     i was forced to buy newer cause iphone   doesnt upgrade anymore to latest ios ,4
741,don’t buy refurbished phone   you will be disappointed ,2
742,the reviews made this seem more like a roulette thing since the iphone that i bought here works as expected  light scratches to the screen  not that many scratches in the back which is good  fingerprint reader works great  very fast  both cameras work great too  the charger that came with the phone along with other cheap ones though don’t work at all  i have to use a really good quality one and it solved my problem  overall i highly recommend to buy this product if you press your luck ,5
743,arrived a day early around noon   boxed appropriately  fully charged and battery performance is excellent so far   my old phone’s battery was near death  then it got sprinkled on in the rain and i knew i had to replace it asap   considering i don’t want to spend    on a phone  i took a chance and crossed my fingers i am very happy and would buy again from them ,5
744,i bought a renewed iphone   because my old iphone was broken  the product looks very new  and it took me only a few minutes to complete the apple settings from scratch  and fill in the sim card  i m very happy to use it ,5
745,my phone sent me a message that the battery was significantly degraded and needed replacement then led me to a best buy replacement appt  they told me the battery was bulging and the screen was not an apple screen  i needed to pay    to get a new battery and a bad report on the phone condition i just bought in late september ,3
746,me encanto,5
747,battery life was low  i had to buy a new battery,3
748,i couldn t transfer my android phone to this one    apps i liked on android would not run on this phone  i would have liked apple if i started with it but i went with a pixel   and am now happier ,3
749,i was very skeptical of buying a preowned device   but i was very impressed but what i received  the phone is in flawless condition and the battery health was     the device is fully operational and    unlocked  the packaging was very impressive and made everything feel premium and brand new  for this price and this condition this was a fantastic deal ,5
750,the battery on my phone is terrible   but maybe that’s just how apple is   my phone will die so fast it’s amazing and i’m constantly charging it  i should have returned this but whatever cuz i think this is just an apple problem,4
751,i want to say that the items that i ordered do not work correctly   the phone s battery is not working   when there is    of the charge left  the phone immediately shows    of the charge  and then turns off after   minutes   the phone cable stopped working two days after purchase   i tried to resolve this issue with support  but they just told me that i should return the phone for my money   i got negative emotions  this phone is not worth the money   i do not recommend to buy ,1
752,i was so concerned reading the reviews on the refurbished iphone eights  i became even more concerned when it took a few days longer to get here  but when it got here i was so happy to see it was in pristine condition and had a    battery life  it also was able to be used with any service provider just like the description claimed  if i ever need to buy another phone i will definitely go through this same company mobilsupply as my distributor ,5
753,the iphone   was in good shape however  the battery life is    maximum capacity left  this is below as what is advertise in amazon for renewed iphone  battery health and guaranteed to have a minimum battery capacity of    ,3
754,it’s good condition  thank you,5
755,y totalmente desbloqueado   lo utilizo en eu tmobile  y en mexico  telcel     con distinto sim   y sin problemas   finciona muy bien y no se perciben daños a pesar de ser usado  ,5
756,i was shocked to see how well the phone had been maintained it really was like new  as far as cosmetics go  the only negative is that the battery is only at about    capacity  or a little over it  however  this was stated in the product description   that the phones would  have at least    capacity  so no big deal just buy a charging case for the phone and you re set  it still works well and is snappy ,5
757,its fun,4
758,bought iphone in august    it worked     month and went dark completely  very disapointed ,2
759,the battery and space always flows smoothly for the first week  we got   different iphones for ourselves and family members from amazon  this includes the new se  two iphone    and an iphone   mini  all started acting funky after a week battery is the worst part family members who received as gifts all live in different states so it would be a headache trying to collect them all back to then wait for replacement phones and reactive etc… ,3
760,phone was as described and works great,5
761,my family has had many great iphones   but this phone has caused me much headache   i first thought it was just a bad battery and a bad charger connection   i replaced the battery  so now it shows perfect health   but the phone still goes through the battery in less than a day    the seller kindly gave a discount for the replacement of the battery  which is why i give three stars and not one    the bad connection persists ,3
762,ordered one of these when my previous iphone’s charging port was damaged   i’ve had good experiences buying from other refurbished iphone dealers on ebay  but this one was not a success it was clean and unlocked and looked good  i was able to activate it and put in my own sim card with no problems  within a few days it was clear that  the battery was not holding a charge  i took it to the apple store for a check up and the battery was bad   i had to have the battery replaced  i also very quickly realized that the camera is not working properly i didn’t want go through the hassle of returning it  as my previous phone was dead and i need a phone   i would not order from the dealer again  buy elsewhere ,1
763,the phone i received was in great condition cosmetically  it looked brand new  however it arrived with a completely drained battery  after a complete charge mine is only able to get to    of maximum capacity  they advertise that their phones will have at least    of original battery capacity  i suspect they packed the phone without turning it off  the other unexpected thing is that the phone i received is not a u s  spec phone  it s a japan spec phone  japan spec phones can’t have the camera shutter sound silenced  not a big deal  but not what i expected ,3
764,the phone came with a number of scratches on the corners and sides and around the camera with a few on the back glass  the battery life is worse than expected and needs to be plugged in multiple times a day  it will give me an alert telling me the phone is at    battery and then a minute later its back up to    and then a minute after it will be down to     not sure what the deal is there but i probably will not be buying again   ,3
765,phone works great and came with    battery life  there were a couple of scratches on the screen  company was willing to refund but we used an otter box and haven’t had any further problems regarding the scratches ,4
766,product was as advertised and in excellent shape ,5
767,packaging was good and came on time  you will need to buy a sim card for the phone  i did notice that the phone seemed to be a little slow button wise  typing in some things took a tad bit longer due to the slowness  everything else seemed to work great  camera quality was good ,4
768,was looking for a phone that had good volume and so far the phone has met that expectation   the appearance of the phone that i received was also above expectations   no whatsoever visible flaws   so far very pleased with my order ,4
769,i needed this phone for the basic but the iphone had many featured  the phone was in excellent condition  my only very small concern was that the phone carried a bit of heat at times ,4
770,purchased this for my son who lost his phone  the phone is exactly as described  had some minor cosmetic imperfections  i was expecting them so no shock   and it works flawlessly  we’ve had it several months now  and no problems   my only complaint was that the shipping took longer  by about   week  than was originally estimated when i ordered it other than the shipping time being a little long  i’m very pleased ,5
771,we bought this phone for an   year old to replace an iphone     we took it to t mobile to switch service from the old phone to the new one   it was a snap  the new phone was in great condition and has face recognition  and a fingerprint reader   we had a protective case and tempered glass to provide protection   this was a super purchase ,5
772,unfortunately  this phone did not work  although it was packaged very well and in very good outward condition  it did not function properly  the screen would freeze and glitch after i tried to set it up  when getting it started  all i could do was click on the language options and then after that it would freeze and that was that  i couldn t do anything else or get into anything else  i thought maybe after having it connected through my service provider it would get fixed but it s simply an issue with the device itself  after getting it activated  i could hear texts coming in  but i had no way of being able to check them  unfortunately  i m going to have to disconnect it and purchase a new phone  very frustrating and disappointing ,1
773,the iphone looks and works great for a refurbished product but it arrived with a degraded battery to    at peak  which apple recommends be replaced  it can t hold a charge for a full day even with app refresh and location services turned off and to web surfing  once the battery is replaced  it s probably still a pretty good deal but this should be disclosed in the description before purchase ,2
774,                    the media could not be loaded                  the phone is great works perfectly,5
775,this iphone   arrived with no imperfections i could find  battery health is barely over   but it was advertised to be over   and it is  it is unlocked but is is an   model which was to be sold in  japan  it does seem to work here in the us though  i’ll use it and see if anything comes up  do far i’m  satisfied ,5
776,replaced a broken iphone with this phone   setup went fine and grandson is happy with the phone only complaint is that fedex s driver couldn t find the address for three days ,5
777,physical condition almost perfect and very happy with that  screen perfect  did not know would have  anew battery and it does not last very long  battery life shows   in settings  gets down to      and then super quickly depleted remaining battery life in matter of minutes of use  if battery was replaced with new before selling these refurbished phones it would be an excellent deal  as is you can consider it a decent deal i expect a year or two out of the phone   ,4
778,this is my   iphone  even though  only an     it is so much better in so many ways than all other cell phones i ve had  able to do so many things not ever able to do before  and siri a time saver and facilitator of immense capacity  even seemingly little things like use of the keyboard functions is better  and i was pleased with the amazon s price for a refurbished phone,5
779,dislike that apple holds a tight grip   cannot use whatsapp backup from an android phone  or anything google for that matter   fewer people would consider switching from android phone to iphone because of this    however  five stars for the seller  ,4
780,the phone is in great shape  not a scratch on it ,5
781,it is lagging,2
782,i bought this phone in   and i still have it  it still works perfectly  i really like it the screen only came with small scratches but that’s all  the camera works so good  at first i thought it was going to be bad but it came perfectly fine so i say you buy it but if you don’t want to risk then don’t but i say yes it’s worth it  the phone will last maybe half a day or half depends how much you use it ,4
783,this was a really good buy  it works out of the united states  which was my main concern because i’m a missionary in south america   and it was in perfect condition  mine even came with a screen protector already attached  i’m bad about dropping my phone so that was definitely a plus  the battery life is sooo much better than my previous    and the camera and everything works wonderfully  the only  only reason i didn’t put a glowing five stars is because i didn’t get any headphones with it  but to be honest  i have no idea if stock iphone  ’s come with headphones or not either  since they have to be bluetooth or lightning ,4
784,i bought this phone a couple of months ago and started using a month ago when my old phone broke  it has been good so far but the touch screen is not very accurate  when i try to move the cursor while writing  it does not move where i touch rather a little above  battery life is good for me because i do not use it all the time  but it turned off twice while i was in a video call ,3
785,this was a  renewed   which i guess is the same as a refurbished   phone   i have been so frustrated ever since i got it that it didn t seem to hold a charge all that long   shortly after my return window closed a friend showed me how to view the battery life   it was in the low    range   had i known that sooner  i think i would have asked for a refund because i thought that despite being  renewed  that it would have a new battery in it   guess not  disappointed ,3
786,i really do not have much to review   i received the phone and case  shield  two day s ahead of schedule  great   took it to my carrier  she was able to    whatever they do  to make it mine  very quickly   but  this has nothing to do with amazon  but the iphone    doesn t have a headphone jack   i had to go out and buy a bluetooth headset  no biggy  but   overall  i am pleased ,5
787,purchased this product for getting a lower costing purchase price on a like new iphone  so far been very happy with it however have found one glitch that is a nuisance but not a deal breaker  on my particular iphone the volume up and down buttons do not seem to work  for me this isn’t a big deal as i use speakerphone    of the time anyway so adjusting the volume is easily accessed through the control center on the phone ,4
788,super happy with the purchase  battery health came at    which is well above the guaranteed     no scratches on the exterior of the phone  and there is a screen protector still attached which is actually pretty nice as i am waiting for my blue light screen protector to arrive and i don’t have to worry until then  super happy it came with a sim card remover so i didn’t have to go into the store to get it changed out  great price  no glitches so far  all around happy ,5
789,this product works good  it came with scratches on the screen but when i was putting on my screen protector it came with a wet wipe and the scratches came right off  the battery life came with    i would rather prefer    but it’s renewed so i can’t change that  over all this prude to works and fella like new no cracks or anything on the back or front ,4
790,i like the iphone   ,5
791,purchase for granddaughter she loves it used it continually,4
792,this is the first time i’ve bought a phone not from my phone company and it came with a broken camera filled with debris so now i have to send it back and hope i get a fully functioning phone back,3
793,i really liked the phone  it did not have any scratches  not even minor ones  everything seems to work fine for me  the battery was at     the charger was not original so i will not probably use it  the box was also generic  however the phone was very smooth and beautiful  i checked all the apps and all the components and everything works great ,5
794,im using the phone right now to write this review everything about the phone almost seemed brand new my only problem was that the battery came with   percent life but im sure thats just the luck of the draw everything else is flawless id trust amazon to enough to buy another,5
795,,5
796,very great product  especially for the price  came very quickly with charger and packaged very nicely  battery life is great  very durable  very minor scratches on back glass  i have used and tested this product for about   months  i can’t compare it to any other renewed devices  it performs so greatly for being renewed  the camera quality it awesome  after some research i found out that nothing had been replaced  and it still had apple care capabilities if i wanted to take it to apple to fix if the screen broke ,5
797,a few years ago  i purchased a refurbished iphone   through amazon with no issue  the phone was great  this has not been the case with the iphone   that i have recently purchased  not only is the battery degraded to the point where it will not reach a full charge of     but also  the speaker used during phone calls is damaged and reaches nowhere near full volume  the casing of the phone  screen  back  etc  were all in great shape but the needed functionality is just not there ,2
798,when the phone is moved back and forth in hand the “ insides” feel like they shift  is that normal for this model  everything seems to work as expected tho  and i  say it is very durable  i dropped it getting out of the car  onto concrete   before i bought a protective case  and it did not show a mark i’m at a loss to understand how my granddaughters repeatedly break the screens on their iphones please tell me if i will be able to use this phone with a norwegian cell service sim card ,4
799,i was not sure about buying refurbished but i have had this phone for quite a while now  i am sure it is over a year   and it has worked flawlessly  it arrived in excellent condition and except with a lot of scrutiny i would not have known that it was not new  for my next time i will definitely try the refurbished again ,5
800,this phone looks perfect and new and it arrived overnight with prime shipping  in ny    i transferred sim cards from my old verizon iphone   to this one  and this new beauty was up and working in   minutes   came in a plain box  with an off name  c  charger and i have not tested the battery life yet   to this point  however  i m thrilled ,5
801,the phone has been working for a week with no issues  on arrival  it was in perfect shape  not a scratch on the case and the screen was perfect  functionally have had no issues  they tested it  i ran some simple diagnostics and found no issues   the only reason for the  battery life    star rating is the battery is at    of capacity  they clearly state in the description that might be what you get  all in all a good purchase at a fair price  if everything they ship is as nice as this phone you will be pleasantly impressed ,5
802,so glad i trusted the positive comments for the seller buyspry  my iphone   looked like brand new and has been working great  even came with a durable screen protector  the generic lightning cable and power brick look and perform just like authentic products  what a great way for me to get an iphone for work without having to spend the    for the newest model  for     i now have an iphone for work so that i can check email and calendar  i still use my android  but my work only allows iphones for exchange access due to apple s stringent security updates  battery life is great  all in all  exceeds my expectations so far ,5
803,absolutely thrilled with this iphone  it is beautiful  i purchased it for my daughter and she loves it  i have a samsung galaxy    and am considering making the switch to iphone because i like this one so well  everything works great  and it shipped really fast  it was a bit difficult to hook up to straight talk  so i would recommend just calling their customer service once you receive a sim card from them ,5
804,                    the media could not be loaded                  fingerprint works greatbattery life is at   there s a really small faint scratch at the back of the phone   nothing major  i seriously  dont mind at all barley noticable the phone was actually  sim unlocked  i got it activated  with at t  great buyi bought it as a gift my sister will love it  it was a great affordable price i was looking for nice phone as cheap as possible you provided it thank you,5
805,the phone has no physical damage  everything work perfect  but it wasn t unlocked  i realized that when i inserted my sim card  it was locked to at t  easy to fix but not as published ,4
806,this is the second refurbished iphone   i have ordered from avant solutions in the last month  both iphones had deficiencies that rendered a return for refund  the first had a worn out recharge plug port that allowed the plug to fall out easily  the second was a malfunctioning speaker  if you can overlook these items  the rest of the iphone functions worked as expected  and so the price you pay for the refurb phone may excuse these deficiencies ,2
807,the overall physical condition of my “refurbished” iphone   is excellent   i can’t find a scratch on the device   the transfer of sim cards to this phone was easy and fast  since the phone was unlocked already   my only complaint is that the battery health of the device is at      when you get below   you start to notice  and in this case  it’s easy to do that   the phone drops a full    charge rather quickly   the price was low enough  that investing in a new battery is worth it   that’s my only complaint   all and all this was a good deal and a good quality iphone   ,3
808,item as described  almost perfect   very satisfied with the quality of this used iphone    battery life was    and not a single scratch or ding  one blemish where the black is there is a white dot but i was expecting a lot worse with some of these reviews  very satisfied    this is a backup phone and a home line for our kiddos when we need to reach them ,5
809,what i expect from a renewed phone ,5
810,i like the iphone line  and upgraded from an iphone     this phone works fine  but it seems to have trouble reading my finger prints   also  the touch on the screen is very different from my old     i do like a little larger screen  and the battery life is better   overall i am satisfied with this phone ,4
811,only had it for a week  then was eligible for trade in,5
812,this shipped and arrived really fast  the phone was in excellent condition  i am happy with both the esthetics and functionality of this phone  i would definitely buy again from this seller ,5
813,i was very skeptical about purchasing this phone  but it turned out to be a great purchase   everything is still working fine  great battery life  i can download tons of apps  and the price was reasonable   i don’t use the face or fingerprint recognitions  but i did try them out when i got the phone and they worked just fine ,5
814,very good,5
815,i got the phone a day early so that was a good start  but the figure print reader had minor issues and something takes a bit to work  the battery life is not that great i mean i have an iphone   and that battery lasted a long time this one dies after a few hours  but what i paid for it i guess it’s what you should expect  better than no phone at all lol,5
816,the good    the phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before christmas    it looked perfect  no physical defects the bad   the ugly    i discovered the phone came from japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off  by law  took it to the apple store  and said they couldn t do anything about it  i take a lot of photos  and the loud click is a pain  but  that was a minor detail for the price    most importantly  the phone locked up suddenly  the apple store couldn t unlock it  the only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings  lost everything that wasn t stored in the cloud  including my photos  the phone has a   gb memory  didn t want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud  let s hope this doesn t happen again    or else  monthly payments on a new phone may no longer look as optional      ,3
817,i went from a samsung android to this iphone     my biggest concern was the size but it s just fine as is   i m so happy with this iphone   it was easy to move everything from my android to this phone  too   i couldn t be happier ,5
818,phone came in really good physical condition  only grip so early  only had phone a week  is that the battery life was at    not the    or above its supposed to be   not a huge deal  but worth noting ,4
819,this phone is in tip top shape and works great    a very good deal ,5
820,clean little phone as in no scratches  but the seller did not refurbish or replace the battery  the battery at full charge lasted   hours  during this time  it sat on a desk not being used or downloading anything  i thought there would at least be a new battery installed  do not buy  and now the amazon app will not let me return it ,1
821,for the past few months was at   bar for most of the day    bars at best performing day or night  always updated the ios and never let the battery   out  did not make a difference  constantly had to walk outside of my job during the day to get       bars  when connecting to wifi problem didn t lessen much ,2
822,i purchased this for my wife  i was very hesitant to purchase refurbished especially when you see reviews of phones not working at all or where product details warn against using phone with any carrier other then att  we use cricket  which uses att towers  happy to report  phone arrived fast  condition was excellent  no dings  scrapes  scratches  or any physical damage whatsoever   packaging was a repack   not original box  but was re wrapped  included new cable and charge block  phone was nearly charged to full  included a nice screen protector  setup was simple as new  no issues with transfer  my wife has been using for   days now and loves it  so far   will update after   days but so far  very pleased and glad we purchased   update     days in and still no issues  very satisfied customer,5
823,i m pleased with my renewed iphone    came as described and in nearly perfect cosmetic condition    looks like brand new and was a breeze setting up battery capacity is at    which falls in line with the description i would recommend if your looking for a cheap older phone in good shape,5
824,i bought this phone in may of    it did have some cosmetic imperfections  but nothing crazy  it has been working very smoothly since the day i ve used it and it s been about   months  everything worked well and smoothly  i m very pleased and impressed at the quality ,5
825,looks brand new   has    battery health great deal for a basically new phone thank youps if u buy amazon renewed make sure the battery health is      as advertised i got burned by a different vendor who expected me to go without a phone during the time it would take to ship the bad phone back   for them to send a new one ,5
826,me gusto mucho,5
827,what i liked was that it was pretty cheap everything was great and the battery life lasted me     hours i went to screen time and it seid   hours and then   becouse when i first got it i was in it a lot then i slowed down i love everything about it but i’m about   months to a year i’m prolly gong to get a new battery but i switched from the   and the   is so much better,5
828,i am so impressed with these phones we ordered  they really are like new  ours came without any physical blemishes  the battery health for each is    and    which is so much better than i was expecting  they included the necessary charging items and a sim card removal tool  i was able to switch out both sim cards for both phones myself and never had to make a trip into our phone provider  easy peasy  we are both pleased with this purchase and would definitely order from this place again  also  the phones came a day early ,5
829,this phone is easy to use   i was amazed at how easy it was to transfer what was on my other iphone to this one   all the apps i had on my previous phone work beautifully on this one   it takes great pictures   love the phone ,5
830,i don t always leave reviews  but i felt i really needed to for this seller because of their great customer service  i ordered a gold iphone    and it came earlier than expected  which was great  for a refurbished phone  i was impressed because it still looked brand new  no scratches    there was a concern about the volume on the phone  but they immediately resolved my concern  they were so kind and understanding  if i ever need another refurbished phone in the future  i will definitely consider them first ,5
831,a great device but the touch screen sucks  it only works when i’m holding the phone  if i lay it down n a flat surface and try to touch the screen   nothing happens   other than that it’s a great device ,4
832,the camera view i love it,5
833,first time i ever bought an iphone online instead of from the service provider   was easy to set up and sync with my other devices   i am very pleased  it came with the charging cable and adapter   the phone was in great condition  not  beat up  or scratched   would buy again   i don t use face recognition so i cannot honestly rate that ,5
834,despite the basic packaging  i was quite impressed with the condition of the phone  it looked brand new without a single scratch  which was one of my main concerns  when purchasing a refurbished phone  it also came with nicely packaged  headphones  aux adapter cable  and a charger  what i like the most about this purchase  was the fact that it was sim unlocked read some reviews saying it wasn’t   i was able to insert my at t sim card and have it work immediately without any complications  i was able to call text people within minutes of activating the phone  i’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet  i’ll update my review if anything changes ,5
835,great condition and    battery very happy also fast shipping i’m very thankful,5
836,very happy with this phone purchase  i have had it for almost a year  when i got it the battery was amazing  it held a charge for a very long time  i could do several things  streaming  taking video  texting  calling  etc  without having to recharge  and then one day like it had a switch it went from excellent to very  very poor  seriously  from one day to the next  when batteries die it is normally a gradual thing  it makes me suspicious of apple  that is not renewed cellular s fault whom i bought the phone from  they sold an excellent product  that battery problem is on apple ,5
837,this is awesome  bought this for my son who is on the autism spectrum  we had an old iphone but he kept stealing my xse   to listen to music  so i needed something better quality sound and with enough storage for his talking app  this is perfect we bought an otter cover and he is set  he loves it for his rewards at school they use his music time  thank you     great,5
838,it was delivered on time  all good  without any complaints  the only detail is a scratch on the top of the phone  the iphone was delivered with a maximum battery capacity of     it is fully unlocked,4
839,looks brand new and works great  ,5
840,it’s been two months since i purchased the phone  i was a little skeptical after reading the mixed reviews but i went for it  so far it’s great  phone and works perfectly   phone was in great condition and looked new   happy buyer here ,5
841,i don’t write reviews but i do read them to make my decision i had a sub of mine but me two gold   iphone  ’s unlocked they are currently running on metro by t mobile  all i had to do was call in and give them my imeis i almost didn’t buy them because of some negative reviews but i’m very glad i did i downgraded from an xs so i’m not    satisfied  but i do love my iphone  ’s it’s been almost   mo this since having them and they work perfectly  no flaws     battery health  almost brand new iphone  came with two original apple chargers no headphones generic box not iphone box ,5
842,it came in great condition thank you  ,5
843,loved the quality of this used phone few marks but barely noticeable after you put on a case ,5
844,this was meant to be a starter phone for my daughter  lookswise it’s perfect  it was delivered earlier than expected but the biggest and most important thing the battery life is not good at all  which for a phone for a teenager is the most important thing and unfortunately doesn’t hold battery on full charge for even half day,2
845,i want to note that this review is   months in to owning my iphone    which i originally loved  i read the negative reviews about the battery life not lasting and thought that was just part of owning refurbished  but wow  this is ridiculous  do not buy from this seller the iphone   generation itself seems like a good buy if you want something newer  i did  because i had an iphone   so i needed an upgrade   i ve always bought refurbished and factory reset  because i ve always been thrifty and as a now stay at home mom of two i need to be thrifty on a budget  i also need a reliable phone when i m home alone with both kids or out driving and god forbid need to make an emergency call  anyways  to the point  saving money was not worth this piece of garbage  it worked great for about six months  i bought the phone at the end of march  it s now mid october and the phone will not work unless it s plugged directly into the charger  if i take said phone off the charger  even at     within minutes the phone dies  so now i don t have a phone and cannot afford to replace it  because in my house    is a lot of money  i would just advise carefully researching and do not choose this seller ,1
846,i buy phones through amazon all the time  i ve only had a problem once  but not with this phone  had it turned on an it was definitely unlocked  so there was no problem hooking it up on the network cricket  no defects what so ever  not with hardware or with screen  or backing or buttons  i was very pleased so is my daughter who the phone was for ,5
847,i was a bit hesitant to buy a used iphone  especially since     is just replaced the battery in my current iphone twice in   months ad     they specifically didn’t guarantee battery life over    — which is when my current iphone started to go kerflooie well  battery life was     the phone case and glass were in a   condition   i was so pleased ,5
848,i have had this phone for one week and it is no longer charging update  the company was easy to work with and refunded the cost of a new battery and charger  which seems to have fixed the issue  good customer service ,4
849,lo estoy usando como mi teléfono principal aunque lo compré para que fuera mi teléfono alternativo  el tamaño me convenció ,5
850,the phone has no scratches or marks and looks new   it came in   days  powered up great  was easy to set up  battery life is good  and it even came with a really nice screen protector professionally put on   i am very happy with this purchase   thank you ,5
851,i got this for my   years old daughter   it was her first purchase  with her own money   so we were a bit  concerned  since the product  was renewed   if we didn t know it was renewed  we couldn t  say  looks like a brand new  i didn t  see any cosmetic detail so far  everything  is working  perfectly and she is very happy ,5
852,pros  everything looked great  much better than expected like new     battery health   little to no scratches on screen even looking at it close up cons  i went to make a call and the earpiece isn t audible on max volume so i have to return exchange  i wasted a few hours setting up the phone and return process isn t the super smooth qr code drop off  you must hunt down a printer  who has one of those these days   and affix the label yourself maybe avoid unless you have a gambler s personality like me with too much time on your hands  there is a non zero chance the exchange i get will also have a problem if they aren t even checking if you can make a call and hear the person on the other end  everyone is different and if you get a great deal go for it  just realize you might have to return it for something more than just regular wear but a functional issue ,2
853,the iphone was in perfect condition  non visible signs of defects so far  at t sim card worked perfect so far functioning well but we have   days to see how it works a you do need a sim card to start the phone up then you can use storage space,5
854,phone almost looked new when it came  phenomenal quality     battery life  overall amazing quality be warned  these phones are sometimes manufactured in japan  and therefore the camera shutter sound never turns off when taking a picture  ever  makes it annoying in public  and is a bit of a downside ,4
855,en buen estado buen estado de bateria detalles minimos la pantalla perfecto estado los botones todos funcionando tenia miedo comprarlo pero me sorprendi me ah encantado,4
856,our next phone is going to be purchased here   easy  quality  hassle free       update   if you have a problem with your amazon refurbished iphone  report it asap   we are conscientious people and take great care with our belongings   after about   months the phone started buzzing and vibrating when we push the home button  it is very annoying and research points to the problem most likely a hoptick problem and not urgent  so we didn t start the replacement right away   the problem intensified so we just went online to replace it   everything shows we are eligible to  return or replace by sept    but the  replace  option is not working online   we just called cs and are told we must return the iphone and we are only being offered a portion of the original price   what a pain   so no we do not recommend this service ,1
857,horrible seller  please stay away   this is my second phone purchased with them and both have had faults with reading any sim  this is not an unlocked phone battery percentage is trash and if you send the item back for a refund the seller harrasses you repeatedly falsely accusing you of not removing your icloud  which i never set up because phone never worked  and threatening to have amazon charge for a phone that never worked  wow never dealt with an unprofessional seller   please learn from this horrible experience of mine and do  not buy  ,1
858,i love it,5
859,i was a little concerned by some of the reviews  i bought this for my daughter   the phone came with a charger in a generic box   the phone looks white to me but the order said silver  it came with a tempered glass screen protector already on   i have not seen any scratches or blemishes  i would count the phone in new condition   we took an att sim card from a samsung galaxy   and plugged directly into the iphone  it immediately worked with no issue   all features work and software is up to date   battery life has been good  we have been using it for about   weeks so far ,5
860,i really like my new iphone  i always wanted a red one so i was delighted when i found this one  it works very well it was in very good condition  i really like it  thank you  ,5
861,the phone arrived clean and in       condition and would be mistaken for brand new if it weren’t for some extremely mild blemishing around the border  like super minor  i have no gripes about the phone so far and am considering another my experience is obviously not going to be shared across the board and can only vouch for the first week’s impression but…so far so good  time will tell ,5
862,so far  so good  have had this phone for one week and it s serving me well  miss the earphone jack  but worth having a phone that works and costs less than new ones  i ll update if anything changes ,4
863,this company provides beautiful renewed products   i wanted to allow some time to pass before writing a review  i couldn t be happier i m very skeptical making larger purchases online especially when it comes to tech products  i m so glad i took the great deal this company offered as they delivered my phone with perfect quality       i purchased the phone renewed and it arrived in seemingly brand new condition  everything works like new  a glitch once in a while is normal for all iphones and i still haven t even seen one  i ve been enjoying this phone every day since i received it ,5
864,the phone works and is very acceptable   would like more volume in speaker but problem is really my ears   battery life between charging is not like new but acceptable,5
865,no issues to speak of as yet  this isn’t the first refurbished iphone ipad device that i have purchased from amazon and in all cases no problems or disappointing issues to speak of ,5
866,the phone battery popped about   weeks ago    first it took forever to charge but i m not the kind to complain i decided to let it be    now it won t charge took it to a place to have it looked at they said battery is done you need a new one and it s cheaper to get another phone,5
867,the longest phone i have ever used  lasted almost   years with no issues,5
868,very happy  only had it for a week but i was very impressed by the quality  honestly  came in a brand new condition  no scratches  bumps  nothing  everything has worked like it is supposed to and yes i was able to easily change sim cards and it worked fine  very please  so much that i am already ordering my second one  hope that it comes in “like new” condition as well ,5
869,shipping was fast but the phone was scratched  sometimes it wont shift between camera settings  and there was no sim card  i was very frustrated i lost my iphone   so the iphone    is my back up  the camera quality feels so poor compared to what i’m used to but that has nothing to do with the seller i just really wish i would’ve been more aware that the seller did not include a sim card with purchase of the phone i live six hours round trip from a verizon store so they had to ship me the sim card before i could even activate the phone  that took another   days ,3
870,perfecto,5
871,easy as pie  i received a well wrapped box with phone  cord  plug in  and sim pin  the directions were clear and easy  my new phone was set up within   minutes    that included multitasking and childcare  i am very satisfied with my purchase  looks and works as new    with a whole year to return it i can’t complain    i’ll never buy a new phone again  thank you ,5
872,although i have bought recondition ones and had no problems this one i bought has a problem communicating without having the speaker voice activated speakerphone with the only way i can get the phone to not break up or so und erratic another words the speaker  i have not heard back from the supplier ,2
873,the phone appears to be in decent condition  some very small blemishes on front screen  but it arrived with a dead battery and it won’t take a charge  i’ve tried several wires  apple brand and in good condition  as well as the aftermarket charge cord it came with and the battery holds at    after being plugged in for several hours  it makes the charge sound when i plug it in  but battery doesn’t take a charge at all ,1
874,this phone works great  we use it on the mint sim network     a month for unlimited talk  text  and data  which is linked through sprint  it was unlocked  it was in great shape and takes great pictures  battery life is as it should be and we have had no problems at all with it since we bought it   months ago ,5
875,work good and looks good  the battery doesn’t last as long as the one we use to have ,5
876,do not buy these   the battery will not hold a charge after   days   this went out at   days and customer service won t help you   the risk reward is not worth it   get another product ,2
877,this product came in good shape but with a completely bad battery  the phone would work until you got to around    and the  would randomly shut off  i had to buy a battery   day after i received it and it cost me another         i bought the   year warrant and paid an extra      for that  i use my phone for business and don’t have time to send it in for warranty so i just paid outta pocket to prevent the inconvenience  i am always worried about buying used things online for this exact reason  with that said the phone works perfect after the new battery was installed  i will be very reluctant to buy used electronics online in the future   which was my gut feeling in the first place   ,3
878,don t buy  we bought this for our son mainly to just play games and watch youtube  worked less than one week and then didn t turn on again  we took it to an apple store and they said it is a japanese model and was junk ,1
879,the phone arrives in perfect condition  cosmetically it looked brand new and i had no issues with any of the functionality  i wound up purchasing   different phones because of the quality  for   or   of the phones they were a dollar or   more but i feel it was definitely worth because of the consistent quality  i used hybrid it as the seller for all   phones i purchased ,5
880,great phone,5
881,the phone overall is good but i saw two problems with the phone like a one tiny cut on the bottom right of the phone and the battery life is on    right but overall the phone is pretty good id say,4
882,this has been the first time i tried buying a refurbished phone  and i was a bit nervous about  but i have been really happy about it i received the phone  and it looks as good as new  no scrathes etc  it did not come with the original charger from apple  but that was not really a problem i have not noticed anything not functioning  or being slightly off  battery life seems great  i have had no technical problems with it  i also did not have any problems with connecting to my sim card and phone company  i have t mobile i think it is a great way to save some money on what is already a pretty expensive phone brand  and i can recommend doing this ,5
883,the iphone   arrived looking like brand new  it even came with screen protector  however  fingerprint sensor did not work  i spent a couple of hours setting and resetting the phone with no luck and just ended up returning it  i didn t test any other phone functions thus have no comments whether other features are in working order  since the phone did not perform as described  i had to give it lower rating  but i went with   stars since the return process was painless  they provided a prepaid ups label  i got refund less than   week after i shipped it back  i will be ordering another phone and hopefully have better luck this time around ,3
884,i returned it because i m used to the size of an iphone   plus  but the phone was flawless  it even came with the sticker on the screen  like it was brand new  the packaging left nothing to be desired  it was   as advertised and gave no problems  i just forgot to notice that it was an   and not an   plus  but that s on me  the product still deserves five stars ,5
885,the phone overall is just fine  i thought that the battery would be leaps and bounds better than my    it is a marked improvement but certainly doesn’t last all day with typical usage  the phones were received with no packaging around it  the phone was in the iphone box but the box had opened in transit and when the box was opened the phone was faced down in the box  i am concerned on the long term jostling that the phone received in transit ,4
886,just as any kids is  he is hard on a phone so i worry how long it is going to last  i m not sure about the battery life being as good as my samsung  he does seem to charge it more than i do mine and i have asked him once or twice he no answer my call and he say his battery is low  don t recall having that issue when he had a samsung  still all the features seem to work fine except for the wifi calling  we ive in the country and respection is not the best so wifi calling is something we do at home  i used his phone the other day because i couldn t find mine and the call i was on dropped three times  was not pleased with that  i even took the time to go find mine to finish my call ,3
887,it was never mentioned in the amazon ad that it is refurbished item  they used a different terminology i have a   days warranty so i m still observing  its performance  actually i didn t mind it s used for that price it s alright ,4
888,great used iphone   amazon let me pay it in   payments    at     ,5
889,i had ordered this for a friend and was a little worried because it was renewed  but when it arrived i was quite impressed not only with the condition  but also the battery life  the condition was mint no scratches it’s basically a brand new phone  the battery had me quite worried but the battery capacity was at    which is like new  so all and all     stars everything went well and no problems ,5
890,i purchased this device as a temporary replacement for a phone that died  in the time i used it everything functioned perfectly and other than a spot on the bezel around the charging port where the finish was worn it looked brand new  according to the built in battery health utility it was in need of service but it lasted me all day with frequent use all in all i would buy another without a second thought ,5
891,this phone appears top be in excellenmmt condition and appearanmce  everythginmg that i klnpow   phones seems to work okay   i am no techie  i am   years old andf use it primarily for talking and texting  it appears to work exactly as it shoul d,4
892,works like new  looks like new  love it  hey  i didn t know it had facial recognition ,5
893,the camera sound  the “click” when you take a picture  cannot be muted  not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the silent mode  i went to the apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired  but they said no  they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced  i found it extremely disappointing  as i would have never bought it if i knew in advance – and i am very surprised that this is an amazon “certified and inspected product”  did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted  at least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off as a loyal customer of amazon  prime too  from several years now  i found it extremely shady  you sponsor a product as certified and tested by amazon qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications  given that amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world  i am based in the usa and knowing that the product would have come from japan and the camera cannot be silenced  i wouldn’t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier this is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process lastly  the battery is weak – it lowers down very quickly and i have to charge it at least three times a day ,1
894,fingerprint recognition does not work but i am old and my prints are very faint   i don t mind because i prefer to use my access code   i do not know anything about face recognition   i tworks with my new apple watch and that is what i wanted ,4
895,my favorite phone so far  works well  the only thing that bugs me is that you can’t silence the shutter sound when you take a picture  it is a japanese model  and apparently it’s illegal to take pictures silently  which is one of my favorite things to do  haha no complaints otherwise ,4
896,so far i think i like android phones better than iphone  but this phone operates and looks like new  the ios seems counter intuitive  maybe i ll grow to love it  what i do like is that it doesn t deplete its battery like an android  seems like a high quality phone  and not as pricey as new after several months of use  i like the device very much  it does what it claims and doesn t seem to have a lot of stuff running in the background depleting the battery and causing overheating like androids i ve had  still frustrated by the arcane lack of file management that forces everything through itunes  some files just don t get transferred to the phone  not the fault of the phone  apple corp just won t allow convenient computer operations ,5
897,product info could of been more specific  also  returns were not more specific ,2
898,reading other reviews made me very nervous to see how this phone was going to turn out  but luckily it works perfectly   there are no problems i have been facing and i’ve had the phone for about two months now  and it is indeed fully unlocked  i tried it with a cricket and metro pcs sim card and they both worked with the phone  i would recommend buying this phone    ,5
899,you rock    this product was absolutely in great condition  my   year old  is getting use to it already  this is her first iphone  she loves it   thank you for making my purchase so easy ,5
900,my   took less that a week to arrive    days to be precise  on free shipping  it is a real value for money  looks and acts like new  battery life is at a     i couldn’t have asked for anything better than this  it even came with a free screen protector  what better value can i get than that  thank you amazon and all the more thanks to the seller  joy goods  ,5
901,small problem with sound distortion that occurred after a couple weeks  but cleaned earpiece and crystal clear sound again  good battery life  satisfied with my purchase thus far ,4
902,great phone,5
903,the physical condition of the phone was excellent with no defects that i have found   the batter had a health rating of     which goes beyond the    minimum guaranteed   moving up to the iphone   lets me use a charge pad  which i really like   had to get used to the feel of the touch  but that wasn t bad  just different from the iphone     i m starting to like it better   haven t used the camera  so i didn t rate it  but expect it to be excellent as well ,5
904,do not purchase refurbished renewed iphones from amazon or this vendor   i purchased this iphone   for my son  last december   the phone started having problems in march  as it would not charge fully and would just shutdown at random times   by late may  the phone would no longer charge or turn on   i took it to the apple store  and after running a diagnostic  they determined that it no longer had the ability to turn on  meaning there was something wrong with the internal hardware   i contacted the seller  and they refused to do anything  just sending me an automated message that it’s past the   day warranty period   amazon  after   phone calls  said the same thing  although i’ve escalated to seemingly the highest tier of customer service  i’m still waiting to here if someone is going to refund me    basically  amazon and this seller took     of my money and gave me a worthless piece of plastic   that constitutes fraud  in my eyes   i’m done with amazon after this experience   beware — apparently the “amazon certification” for refurbished phones is worthless ,1
905,little apprehensive based on some reviews so i upgraded to the “premium” option   i am glad i did   phone arrived with just one very faint feather scratch near the bottom  not noticeable when in use but otherwise looked brand new   had it now for a week and it has worked flawlessly   the apple battery health indicator shows    so that was a nice surprise   i upgraded from a   and it’s definitely a huge upgrade so i am overall very pleased with the purchase ,5
906,my wife had a iphone   for almost   years the battery was going so i was able to get her the iphone   with the same storage as her iphone    she is using the same case as her old phone  it was very easy to get all her information transferred to this phone very happy,5
907,i saw multiple reviews talking about how these refurbished phones were horrible and i was skeptical at first but i am glad i took the plunge and purchased this used phone  it is pretty much like new and was shipped clean and ready for setup  no issues with it thus far and battery life seems appropriate  i will certainly do business with this seller again,5
908,the battery does die a bit quick but almost all apple products have that issue rn xd i absolutely love it and it came so quick   i got the iphone   after i fell and broke my old one this one has been really reliable and glad to have done business with you guys            happy customer,4
909,great,5
910,looks and works just like a new one except the battery  but that was expectable for the smartphone made more than   years ago got it a good discount  it came in generic box with charger  cable and a pin unlocked  as it was claimed so  i m glad for  purchasing it got exactly wanted to  and with good price ,5
911,the phone had no scratches or defects and it even came with a screen protector  we put the sim card in and it all worked perfectly  i used to purchase my used phones from a different website and things just didn’t run as smoothly with that website the price on amazon was way better and the phone was perfect  i will always purchase from here from now on ,5
912,just received the phone  came earlier than expected  even came with a few extra “goodies” from the shipper  back case and front cover   looks brand new and metropcs was able to switch out my old motorola   phone   all my contacts  photos  sim card   everything into this phone  now i need to learn how to use it so far i am very impressed i’ll update my review in   days ,5
913,i never owned an iphone until i purchased the refurbished iphone    it worked fine and allayed any fears i had about buying a used phone  it turned out to be a good way to save money and get a decent phone in the process ,5
914,this was for my granddaughter and she was well pleased with it   she has had no problems with it and it does everything she needs it to do ,5
915,this phone came looking and performing as a new item  very pleased with it  it took a week to get it  but still reasonable time  the price was fantastic  less than    including delivery ,4
916,this is the first iphone i bought for a family member they liked the phone but once again the charger broke in half the first day the tried to use it i want these sellers to know that whenever you buy a phone the charger is jus as important as the phone i was blessed because i already had a iphone charger ,4
917,                    the media could not be loaded                 ,3
918,cosmetically  the phone was in excellent condition  the battery health was at     even with little to no usage the battery drains fast and requires charging every two days ,3
919,bought this phone to replace my husband’s antique iphone since he kept blaming for not putting my calls through     the phone we received works well  no cosmetic complaints  battery life seems good  we downloaded the latest ios without any problems  husband likes it ,5
920,if your phone comes with a screen protector i would remove it and inspect the screen  mine had a glass screen protector that was not clear on the edges  it masked some blemishes on the screen ,4
921,received on friday   transferred data and programs from old phone on sunday   will be hooking it up to at t on monday   so far the phone works well  except the battery seems to discharge rather quickly  possibly a result of too many apps running  but i ll be checking that out soon    in any event  i am quite pleased with my purchase ,5
922,i bought from buyspry and i could not be happier  phone looks and responds like it’s brand new  i have a safe link sim card and i used to have a samsung phone  i popped in the sim card and it worked immediately  in the box i got a charger cord and a charger box along with something to take out the sim card tray  they may not be what you get in a regular iphone box but it all works great  also it did come in a generic smartphone box  i definitely do not regret this purchase  phone absolutely looks brand new ,5
923,decent little phone  i do have an issue with phone calls  i can get them but no one can hear me talking  but this is only sometimes ,4
924,el vendedor envió el teléfono bloqueado con una clave de seis dígitos y no informó  tuve que pagar    para desbloquearlo  además la publicación dice este anuncio incluye     apple iphone      funda protectora transparente con absorción de impactos     soporte ajustable y plegable   cargador de coche usb     de carga rápida     cable lightning de carga     cubo de alimentación usb   paño de microfibra de limpieza de lo cual sólo trajo el iphone    cable usb y cubo de alimentación deben ser más transparentes con lo que publican y con lo que en realidad envían al cliente ,5
925,after reading some of the reviews on the reseller buyspry i was actually terrified of buying this phone  probably one of the riskiest clicks i ve had to do however  the phone arrived neatly packaged  exactly as advertised  with cable   wall charger and it looked brand new  there were a few light scratches on the screen and on the glass behind but the type of scratches that are only visible under certain angles and with lots of light   personally not a problem at all  at first glance  it looks absolutely spotless   like a new phone  battery capacity health  the you can check at settings  was at    which seems pretty good  overall  so far zero complaints  phone looks amazing   works just as good ,5
926,it was like a brand new,5
927,like new,5
928,i ordered this phone fully unlocked in a desperate attempt to get a quick replacement for the one i dropped in a toilet   after purchasing  i read the comments thoroughly and thought the phone would not be compatible with my boostmobile network   i even contacted the seller to alert them to my potential return   when it arrived  i immediately took it to boostmoble to see if it would work   it was a success   however i had to pay     bucks   my iphone   memory card is not compatible with the     i had to buy a compatible boostmobile sim card   i love my new phone   great quality ,5
929,the phone came well packaged with no damage  my son main complaint is the phone would not keep charge for a long time  the charger has a black piece that goes to the wall  otherwise  it looks good ,4
930,i have not had any issues with my new phone so far  i have been using it for about   days   getting the phone set up and all of my data moved onto it was no problem  it says that the battery has    capacity  which is within the range that the description suggested  i would order this product refurbished again  but hopefully i don t have to     ,5
931,this product is renewed by amazon but is sold by a third party vendor  i received the iphone and attempted to set it up from transferring from another iphone  during the process it required me to update the software from     to      doing so  locked up  the iphone to the point restore or updating was useless  i called the seller and notified them of the issue  i was told i would have to return the item and buy a new iphone to replace this defective unit  this is where it gets crappy  i submitted the online return thru amazon and labeled the item as defective with description and printed of the shipping label  only to find out that the shipping label requires the purchaser to pay return shipping  even though the product is defective  i called amazon renewed number because they  guarantee     customer satisfaction  and i was told that i will need to go out and pay for return shipping  call amazon back with the amount  and then will have to mail in the receipt to be reimbursed  not really sure if this is what is meant be    customer satisfaction if i have to do all this work for a defective product do yourself a favor and buy only from amazon prime and free return shipping  don t trust renewed    customer satisfaction promise update        amazon still did not want to issue a credit for defective return shipping  the seller stepped up and addressed the issue and refunded ,1
932,product was faulty from day one  a couple large chips on edge and shakey back camera  i felt they should have sent me another one so i could then send this one back  instead seller wanted me to be without phone for weeks to return and receivea replacementafter receiving  so i just kept it due to the inconvenience  monumental mistake  within a coulpe of months the phone barley charges even with new quick charge charger  it started hissing and buzzing after turning on back camera  i m waiting on this thing to explode  such a waste of money and seller is not recommend for sure ,1
933,got this to upgrade a family member from a   and they love it  no problem setting up new phone and  seems to be working great with no issues  will update if anything changes  packages was awesome and arrived quickly  like new condistiob and battery life seems to be good for a renewed phone so far very happy with this product ,5
934,i seriously love this phone  i was impressed with the quality provided at such a low price  the phone works like new except for the battery which seems to die slightly faster than expected  perhaps the previous owner kept leaving the phone charged overnight always unplug your phones once you see    battery     ,4
935,looks and runs like brand new,5
936,screen looks like a new one  no scratch back of this phone looks good too dry glue can be seen at the edge an obvious damage at the bottom  but it doesn t hurt much though battery is good  feels like a new battery so  overall  for a refurbished phone  this is a pretty good one for the quality and price    ,5
937,overall a great phone for my daughter  excellent photos   battery life us pretty short though  but works great overall ,4
938,so i ordered the iphone in gold   gb  fully unlocked  but what had came was the iphone in black but totally unlocked  i made sure i ordered the gold one  only a few bad things battery health was at   when i first got it and just realized only one of the speakers works  the left one does not work  but in general the phone is good,4
939,i love everything  i was so scared that this was a scam or that it wasn’t going to work but it has definitely been way better then i could have imagined  for it being renewed  it was as if i got it straight out of the factory at apple  wonderful product ,5
940,ive been pleased in the past with amazon refurbished products as i’ve had many electronic in the past and have not until now came across a displeasing product i’ve bought the iphone   and there seems to be a tint as wide as an inch from the top of the screen  also the speakers are terrible whether playing music or listening to calls ,2
941,i bought this twice  two years apart  the first one i sent back because the battery went south way too quickly and they sent another lickety split  then i broke it fair and square the one this time looks absolutely new with not so much as a smudge  con  this battery health is at     which is easily acceptable for a phone selling at    off the original price  a sixty dollar battery  repair  in a year is well worth it buy this one  if yours isn t perfect  send it back for another  every used phone can have problems but that doesn t mean every used phone has one  if you don t understand this  go buy a new thousand dollar phone and be happy ,5
942,i was excited to receive my phone  but soon realized it wasn’t running correctly  it has a few unexpected quirks one being the battery is worse than my   year old phone  i’m so disappointed  i was going to return it  but read through the return policy and don’t want to chance receiving only a partial credit      restocking fee up to no credit    i would suggest taking your business to a place with less risk and better care of their customers ,2
943,the seller was one of the most helpful and professional sellers i ve ever done business with  i had an initial problem with the serial number but as soon as i registered a complaint  the seller reached out to me within   and kept in touch until the issue was resolved  i received another phone and everything worked out great  i d definitely use the seller  hybrid it  again ,5
944,it has been a good phone thus far,5
945,camera works great too  just pop in my sim card  worked like a charm  its the third phone i buy from same place  have not had any problems  i bought three phones for the whole family  highly recommend buying if you don t want to spend a whole lot of money   my wife uses it to make short videos ,5
946,very satisfied in all aspects so far ,5
947,good  ,5
948,my mom just upgraded her phone and lost it so we bought this one for her and so far it’s working great ,5
949,for   this is a great deal  only problem is this is a japanese model and should be advertised as such  one  and very annoying difference is the stupid camera sound is forced on no matter what  all those perverts over there in japan need to calm down  besides that  the phone is of above average condition with a few minor blemishes  but that’s to be expected at this price  battery is at   ,4
950,i was so nervous about ordering a refurbished iphone off amazon but this was worth the money  i ve had the phone for about a week now and i have no complaints  cosmetically  there were a few scratches by the power button and on the lower left portion of the screen but i put on a case and glass screen protector so you can t even see the scratches anymore  my phone came with    battery health remaining  my t mobile sim card booted up just fine and i had no issues with creating getting the phone set up  would recommend ,5
951,i bought the renewed iphone   to replace an iphone   i had for years  the iphone   worked great  but recent ios updates to my ipad caused it not to sync reminders with the iphone   anymore and no future updates would address that  so  i decided to get a new phone and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on it  i’m very happy with my purchase  it looks new  works as it should and has good battery life  and i have a few features i didn’t have in the old phone  i wouldn’t hesitate to buy a renewed  unlocked  iphone again ,5
952,i was a bit hesitant with this purchase because of the mixed reviews but i ended up buying it   it came in just today and works perfectly fine  the phone came without any scratches and without any trouble connected with cricket easily   i ordered the phone full unlocked and based on others reviews was a bit scared of getting it with another company or getting it not unlocked  the phone came in with a charger but no headphones  you ll have to use your own tool when it s time to remove the sim card  overall for right now the phone works fine but will update the review if any problems come in the few days ,5
953,this phone is very great just like an actual iphone you would get from apple  i really like this phone and the looks  its just like an real apple iphone  you cant tell if its refurbished or not thats how good it is    ,5
954,phone came perfectly working as expected  very nice to come with a charger and i dont mind that it doesnt have a headphone jack adapter  nothing wrong with the phone software wise  but there do seem to he quite a grea amount of scratches on the screen itself that are pretty shallow but still a lot for a renewed phone  you dont really notice them but i hope no one else gets a somewhat marked up phone like i did  besides that i love the phone and recommend this product if you need a cheap alternative to a pretty relevant iphone in    highly recommend,5
955,en perfecto estado  como nuevo y es rápido,5
956,is ok when i  use but i didn’t receive headphones  ,3
957,came in a box and i thought i got scammed and nope i didn’t it was secure and packaged carefully and came with charger and cord and phone worked great i still have it and no problems so far within   months,5
958,i ve had this phone for a little over a month now and i love it  i was somewhat scared to buy a refurbished phone  but so far this phone is working wonderfully and arrived in nearly perfect condition  there was a teeny tiny little scratch on the side of the phone  but it is barely noticeable  i only noticed it because i was looking for imperfections when i received the phone  it is much cheaper than buying an apple certified refurbished phone and is probably the exact same quality  unfortunately  the charger is not an apple product  but is working well so far  if you re looking for a quality new phone that is not ridiculously expensive  i would highly recommend purchasing this one ,5
959,apple products are expensive   many people cannot wait to upgrade   our family just waits for people to do just that and for companies to refurbish perfectly good phones   this one came in less than   days  all functions working properly  just as advertised was unlocked  bluetooth transfer of data in less than   minutes   the only slightly negative comment is that the refurbished phone came with generic charger and not apple products   no ear bud jack in this phone  so remember to get wireless earbuds ,5
960,the battery was supposed to be at    i believe  it was not   right off the bat the battery had to be replaced   the phone is sub par and little to no upgrade from the   that i was using one of my main reasons for upgrading to the   was for a better battery life  it s actually worse even with the new battery   but once you move everything over and pay for the battery it s too late to return ,3
961,i think i waste my mony buy renewed because this product is not giving me satisfaction like home button still not work some time and side screen is glu showing and below the home button scratchs are there,1
962,it came with a deep scratch on the left bottom of the screen by the bottom  it’s a large scratch too ,4
963,phone was a  renewed  phone   in excellent condition and arrived ahead of schedule   battery life isn t great  but not sure that s the sellers issue   i bought the phone to be able to face time with family and grandchildren   i typically use an android  but this phone does what i need it to do   i would purchase from this seller again ,4
964,i ordered   phones  and should have expected the worst since what i got wasn t all that  one phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches  a few deeper ones  and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable  photos attached just of this one phone   along with that  the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway  which was ok and what i expected   the other phone i got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side  on top of that  the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them  both phones turned on fine  sound worked and touch screens worked normal  however i didn t even bother setting them up since i was going to return them since this item is    less than a new iphone    doesn t come with apple charger or headphones  the price difference wasn t worth it in my opinion and i ended up returning both of the phones  i m leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since i expected to possibly return these phones anyway  just expect the worst but low key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones ,2
965,pro s  phone came within   days  which was incredible and much sooner than expected phone was in excellent cosmetic condition  no knicks or dents or scratches  beautiful condition con  this is my first ever iphone  after dealing with the pain in the     id set up and transfer from android to apple with my carrier    the battery was the biggest disappointment  the battery went from    to    within a couple minutes now  i will be out the phone  the money i spent for a couple days and having to transfer everything back over  drop off to mail back   needless to say i should have been more suspicious of the previous comments on the battery life have one more phone coming and wondering now if i ll have the same issue  so disappointed  if i knew for certain i would not have this battery issue again  i would purchase again  the shipment was super fast and again  the physical appearance of the phone was fantastic  but big no on the battery life ,2
966,phone was exactly what it advertised  gsm unlocked  took it over to at t and bought a phone plan w sim card  received a new number and bought a phone case  no hassle or issues  phone case i would buy from amazon next time  cost there was       and it wasn’t an otter case ,5
967,  couple of days worked fine then the speakers for hands free started not working people couldn’t hear me clearly said that i sounded muffled  then died tried to charge nothing   it is dead it won’t charge or turn oncannot remove the things they want to return because it is totally dead  i am sending it back for a replacement ,1
968,very disappointed  the screen at times is unresponsive  which is annoying but could be overlooked  but upon unboxing the phone the bottom speaker did not work at all and the top speaker is about to go  the charge also says    but only lasts   hours with little to no use which is extremely disappointing  the seller so far has accepted my return   will update if i am properly refunded  update  thank you for the prompt customer service and refund ,5
969,after reading many one star and five star reviews i decided to order this  it came a few days early  battery life was     everything looks and works good as new  the transaction from my old phone to this one was easy and flawless  touch screen and home button work great so far     ,5
970,phone arrived   day early   looked brand new   no scratches   marks   etc   charging block and cord included   much to my surprise the phone came with a screen protector installed restored our data phone works fine   we’re a very happy customer ,5
971,i didn’t know the phone could charge wirelessly  battery life is very good ,5
972,phone works as advertised and was in pristine condition when it arrived  no problems what so ever  i would recommend this seller ,4
973,coming from a person that owned an iphone   for almost   years  this phone is an absolute unit  i love it’s interface  the remarkable speed  and the impeccable battery life  i expected this phone to come with a scratch or two or at least an    battery life but it came with zero scratches and a    battery life  definitely worth the purchase  it also came with a pin to manually switch over my sim card from my old phone to this one  fully unlocked already as well ,5
974,i received this iphone   on march   and yesterday march   it started making loud popping and crackling sounds while i was speaking to a friend  at first  because these sounds were so loud  i didn t realize they came from within the phone  how could any decent quality control testing miss this ,1
975,no issues with phone   operates normal  it replaced my older model apple phone that had a terminal illness  i don’t need all the latest technology and this worked out ,4
976,this is the third apple phone i have purchased refurbed and unlocked   no issues at allno defects  had a glass protector on the glass screen already  charged to    which is not the norm and the hounds have been released for the child to have fun   all kidding aside  i would buy again without question   peace ps nobody paid me for this review or gave me any special give aways to do so ,5
977,llego muy rápido  esta en muy buen estado  y funciona genial ,5
978,i do wish it had a bigger screen like the newer phones  but it is nice in that it uses the finger print tech where as the newer once require face recognition  i m not too comfortable with that  been working great last   months  i ordered one with   of memory so i don t run out ,5
979,phone is great except the screen   when replaced the new glass it too thick so phone cases squeeze the screen so tight it won’t work   no case is dangerous to the normal phone owner ,3
980,he liked the color  the size was a little smaller than his other phone though  the price was reasonable ,5
981,fast delivery  phone works great,5
982,the phone it self is in great condition  the only problem i had with it was  for some reason it was not compatible with my service boost  which was very strange  but i took it to sprint and was able to switch providers and didn’t have to pay an extra fees and turns out sprint had the phone plan i was offered at boost but for   dollars cheaper ,4
983,was able to switch it over with no problems  works great ,5
984,the phone is fine  but the back camera is trash   it was broken  this is why i gave it   stars ,4
985,it works great  my girlfriend loves it  if my phone goes out  i would buy one of those for myself ,5
986,it’s good so far  it came with scratches on the screen but other than that so far so good  battery life is doing good and the home button   finger print reader  is great ,4
987,i was worried buying refurb but so far phone is working great   time will tell ,5
988,believe this phone came from overseas because the camera shutter sound will not mute even with the silent switch on  called apple and they told me overseas phones have this feature that is not controlled the battery life is at     the cosmetic of the phone is outstanding and the phone did come in a apple box  daughter can t get passed the shutter sound and battery life so we will are returning ,4
989,this item stop working after a month you can hear it ring and can’t answer it it just stopped working we can hear or watch videos we are not able to do anything on it at all  i am not pleased with this purchase,1
990,they sent me an iphone that looked to be in good shape  only when i was going through the settings did i see that there was a battery maintenance warning and the max capacity of the battery was    and not the advertised minimum     its frustrating because they knew this sending it to me  they written on the packaging that the battery capacity was         ,2
991,you can bearly hear on facetime and on speaker phone,2
992,had to replace my moms iphone    and i was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews  it shipped very quickly and it showed up very well packed  opened and gotta say it looks brand new  not a scratch or dent  came with like a   charging cable  put the verizon sim in and bam set it up  was easy  no issue at all  my mom loves it and would definitely would buy again ,5
993,ngl yo i was scared to buy this phone at first cause of all the bad reviews i was seeing but then i ordered it and it came and i was shocked like this shii actually valid it came with like one tiny scratch on the side but that s nothing everything works perfectly sounds everything,5
994,so far so good  it worked perfectly   i have an account with att go phone prepaid  i had no issue transferring from my old iphone to this one  work great  keep it my fingers crossed  seems like a steal  too good to be true  affordable iphone works with prepaid no issue transferring photos contacts and apps ,5
995,i was testing out the phone and making sure everything was working and i noticed that the microphone for the phone does not work at all so when i get calls or record videos the microphone does not pick anything up ,4
996,you know these ratings are very important for the person reading this   honestly i was worried that is wowouldn be all it said it would be but it was and is a great iphone for its use  thank you,5
997,no scratches on screen or glass on the back of the phone  came with some fingerprint marks and dust  but nothing you can t wipe off  the phone functions perfectly  all features of a new iphone    battery saves on some apps  but others it drains fast  not sure if its the app s size  or phone s battery  overall it works  functions  and looks just like a brand new phone  the only thing is that it doesn t come with a generic apple charger  it comes with a cheaper one that takes longer to charge  and also no earbuds  i would highly recommend ,5
998,i bought this phone unlocked to use in another country  i had no problems buying and activating a sim card and it works great  the only problem i have is that there was a scratch on it that was partially covered up with a glass cover  i didn’t like the attempt to hide this  i do not live in the us and can’t easily exchange it and i needed a phone for international use  other than that the phone works great and i am happy with my purchase ,4
999,i was skeptical about ordering a phone from this company went my daughter phone broke   but i took a chance   once i received it i called verizon and it was easy to set up  no problems and    cheaper than buying from verizon directly   where i live we can only use cdma phones so i was nervous   again worked great,5
1000,i don’t always write reviews but i’m so happy with the condition of the iphone i got  no visible scratches or dents  i get all my calls and text messages i just put my old at t sim card in and it works perfectly  only downside is battery maximum capacity is     but i feel that is fair enough because the product description says     which it is  don’t buy one of these if you need a better battery life ,5
1001,i had bought this as a back up phone for when my older phone dies  i didn t needed it right away and did not test it   hard lesson learned   it s now past the return date and i have a phone that does not take any charge  it s been on a charger for   hours and has no charge  will not turn on  just has the battery with the red bar picture showing  charger was tested and it is working fine  so disappointed  i never had an issue with refurbished items and now i m without a phone ,1
1002,everything else worked but it came with    battery capacity  other than that its good,4
1003,despite the battery health stating     the battery does not hold a charge for more than a few hours i attempted to work this out with the seller prior to posting a review  but they are unwilling to reimburse me for a new battery  nor do i have an option to message them directly again i would not buy from this seller again ,1
1004,i really wish we could use it  but it s just basically a game unit or good for the web and talking to others who have an i phone m,4
1005,dislike battery life,2
1006,this refurbished iphone arrived on time  it was wrapped properly in a sturdy box  it came with the charger cord and plug  it has been working fine to replace the old phone my husband had  it was fully charged and he was able to load all his info from his sim card with no problem  contacts and photos loaded from icloud  good experience  thank you ,5
1007,really nice    it seems a brand new iphone    out of the box   at first  i wasn t sure whether i should buy or not because of there are a lot of negative reviews for this particular phone along with its seller  vendor    thus far  i have no issue with the iphone     of course  all consumers would be so cautious when he she is looking for a refurbished used phone   if i were to pick one minor thing that this phone should have is that  no place for an ear pieces    other than this particular one is missing  i would highly recommend to others to consider if you re looking for a refurbished iphone ,5
1008,was a bit skeptical but actually relieved to say that i am very pleased with my iphone   almost couldn’t tell it was renewed so far anyway seems like everything is working just fine,4
1009,worked well for a bit  but then just stopped working for me not even a year after purchase  do not recommend,5
1010,it works very well and looks like new  my only complaint to be honest would be that the battery unfortunately was at    but there’s not much more i can ask for due to the amazing price,5
1011,so far no complaints ,5
1012,the left side of the screen when you try to text the numbers or letters  won’t let me push them all the time  i have to shut the phone down and restart for it to be ok again ,2
1013,awesome ,5
1014,only thing that i didn’t like was that i had to clean the speakers so the sound sounded right  other than that  the phone came in near perfect condition ,4
1015,i bought this for my husband for christmas  he has wanted an iphone for a long time  the phone was in really nice condition  it did have an      ” slight scratch on the screen  but once i put on the tempered glass screen protector on you could barely even notice it  all functions of the phone are in working order  very happy with this purchase ,5
1016,not a single scratch on this phone and the battery life is    which is basically new to me  very thankful for an affordable upgrade option without the hassle of monthly payments  just moved my sim over and the data transferred quickly from my old iphone via bluetooth  ,5
1017,honestly this phone turned out good  i have no problem with it so far  the only thing i didn t like is it s not gold colored like the title said   it s more of a soft pink color  other than that it s a great deal  ,4
1018,overall is great just like new except for one issue  mail app somehow still shows as the previous user s name or initial when i lightly tapped on “mail” app icon  it prevents me wanting to use “mail” app  can someone give me instructions on how to fix this  thanks ,4
1019,i have to say this was fast shipping as my   plus motherboard died i needed a cheaper version  the shipping was fast  the wire and block that came with it were dirty knockoffs thy didn’t work  the phone was just thrown in some random phone box aside from that the phone was in great condition  no scratches no cracks  and the battery life which i was absolutely shocked at was   good cheap buy for a good phone  i would recommend ,5
1020,i was in the market for a renewed iphone     and a friend suggested i purchase from buyspry based on their experience  honestly  i m not sure why buyspry has only an    seller rating over the past   months  the iphone     i received is in like new condition  after restoring the phone from my icloud backup  i immediately went to the battery in settings and was very pleased to find battery health of     very pleased  i will update this review if anything goes wrong within the   day amazon return period ,5
1021,item arrive on time  well packed and safe box  item was in a great shape  only a tiny scratch on a side of the cell phone  nothing that anyone can t leave with  even with cover you will never see it   all good till we start using it  battery life was not good and we just returned it for refund  great follow up and refund received after item arrived to vendor  thanks ,3
1022,i purchased two iphone   from this seller  one of the phones turned out to be defective  the issue with the phone was that the fingerprint scanner didn’t work  these were meant to be a gift for my niece  the description says everything is fine with the phone initially  i should have checked the phone before i passed it to someone  overall  i d say so far  good with the purchase  but since it was an unlocked phone and in excellent condition  the phone should have been working like a regular phone with no issues ,1
1023,i use my phone daily  i really like the fingerprint reader for easy access to my phone  i can use my phone all day on just one charge ,4
1024,great deal    i bought   at a time  and both came brand new  perfect ,5
1025,i’m pleased with phone and how good it works battery life is ok   i do have one spot in the bottom left corner that does not respond well to touch ,4
1026,small crack can t even see it  overall very satisfied with the purchase ,4
1027,the phone arrived in excellent shape  the unit comes with a new charger and card  i put my sim card in and had no issues  as long as your old sim card came out of an iphone  if you are upgrading from and android you will need to get a new sim card from your carrier  no reflection on this unit itself  just a technology issue between the two operating systems   this phone works great ,5
1028,it’s in a great condition  has signs off wear and tear but that’s expected  battery health came on    not the best but it’ll do  fingerprint scanner work perfectly same as the camera    ,4
1029,works great  price is good for an iphone ,5
1030,i bought this for my kid around last month  the battery health is still     and no visible scratch that i can find  the phone also works fine and normal after a month of use  this is a good buy  i will definitely come back to this seller if i m going to buy another renewed phone ,5
1031,battery came with    health  they say it should come with    or more  otherwise a really good buy  the phone came in good condition and everything listed came as well,4
1032,i m very pleased with my  new  phone  it was a great value ,4
1033,the phone looks fairly new  i do like that it have a screen protector already on it  the screen does have a couple scratches  but i can’t tell if they’re on the phone or the protector  overall  it’s a great phone  have had no issues with it ,5
1034,renewed iphone is great  the charger however  a thin black plastic replacement  i travel  unlike the apple charger  this plug portion cannot be replaced w an alternate country s plug  it also fits too loosely in the wall  had to use a floor strip to keep it plugged  i know accessories can be replacements  but they have to have same function capabilities  hoping i can get a comparable one sent by the seller  amazon responded quickly to the complaint  however  and gave me a credit for a future purchase ,3
1035,i am so embarrassed that i didn t read the reviews about this seller before purchasing  i check reviews for everything     what was wrong with me      i had a couple glitches with this phone from the start but i though it was just me not understanding a newer iphone s features   but the finger recognition never worked that even worked on my     now the home button won t work at all  i am terrified that this is a stollen phone and all my data is getting leaked or something  i wonder if the seller will even respond ,2
1036,iphone came on time  finger reader works  no cracks  almost no scratches  unlocked and connected to my carrier  front and back camera works great  everything works on this phone  came with    battery health and with charger   i would recommend buying and i’m extremely happy with my phone ,5
1037,got the phone yesterday  seems to work fine  i haven t tested all features yet but it powers on fine   the speaker and charger ports are all filled with dirt  the screen looks pretty good but the back glass got a lost of scuffs marks  the biggest issue is that this listing claims that it is unlocked and works on all carriers including verizon but the model that i got only works on gsm networks such at at t and t mobil not on verizon or sprint  most people don t know but there are two versions of iphone   unlocked    which works on all carriers gsm and cdma and   which only works on gsm carriers  the amazon should be clear about which model is being sold so not to waste customer s time   ,3
1038,i bought this phone for my teen grandson  when i bought it  the estimated delivery time was     weeks  that wasn’t an issue as he has a phone  though it’s condition wasn’t great  and he didn’t know this was coming  but  it shipped in about   hours and was there within   days  he has had several days and when i asked how he would rate the quality of this phone and company  he immediately said      way to go ,5
1039,the iphone came packaged as if it was brand new   transfer of data from iphone   was easy and complete   i purchased a second iphone   for my my wife and it too was in pristine condition   the verizon sales rep who did the transfer of info also believes that they both were new   great deal and an excellent upgrade for us and our needs ,5
1040,i didn’t leave my house for the   years bc covid and bought this iphone bc i was about to be leaving again and needed a phone  this was a huge mistake  i didn’t start using the phone till about a month ago so i didn’t notice that the speaker sucks  when i get phone calls or call out it’s so freaking quiet even on what should be loud speaker phone  the battery life is absolutely amazing but the speaker to hear doesn’t work so this phone is useless to me  i am older and don’t need much phone use but to call when i really need to but this phone does not fulfill that job  super duper sad bc the return window is closed which is stupid  if you are going to buy this phone don’t just assume that since everything else works that the speaker will be loud  oh also the bottom of the touch screen doesn’t work so i have to use the talk to text bc the space bar doesn’t work and the bottom row of letters  i do not recommend  updated  the phone no longer charges ,1
1041,solid bang for your buck used iphone  i got the   now  came with a    battery  as in  it’s actual battery life not the percentage of battery you see at the top right hand corner of your screen  decently fast  should hold up for awhile ,5
1042,if you do not have tech skills or trouble following instructions    be prepared to send another    to have it set up  if your an android person   be prepared for some headaches getting to know the ios ,4
1043,todo esta bien mi único error fue escoger el celular más pequeño es lo que no me gusto e estado notando que la batería del cel  se descarga muy rápido no entiendo que le pasa a mi cel  pensé que estaría exelente todo,4
1044,it’s a great phone for a great price   my o ly issue is that it was originally intended for sale in a country where you can’t silence the camera click noise   not a huge deal but it confused me for a while   the battery life is excellent and the fingerprint is perfect   those were the two things that had gone wrong on my old iphone   so i’m happy to have those functions back ,4
1045,phone seems to be fine so far  but a little worried that the charger they sent didn’t work at all  pain in the butt as my daughter is always stealing my charger  they told me they would send me a new charger  but i still have not received it   weeks later ,3
1046,bought this to replace my old iphone   that was the exact same specs  i do feel like the battery life is lasting longer on the new replacement versus my old one  it did come with a charger  not apple but it s fine  and sim popper  my new phone is working just fine  have not had any complaints  ,5
1047,so far so good  haven’t had any issues  the phone looked new  i was skeptical based off reviews  thinking maybe it’s because people only leave a review when they are unhappy  i’ve had it for   days  very fast delivery and no issues yet  i will update if anything changes ,4
1048,the phone is in great shape and works well  only complaint is that the earphone front speaker sounded extremely quite and muffled  i did a lot of troubleshooting and almost sent it back  looking closely  the small holes in the speaker grill looked to be clogged  i used a piece of painters tape kinda like a black head strip to remove this  i used a toothpick to get the tape in around the edges around the opening  i did this several times  seems like the last owner may have gotten makeup transferred in there over time ,5
1049,package arrived as advertised  phone  charger cord and charger block  upon first inspection the phone appears as good as new  no physical marks of any sort  only thing that didn’t work was the left speaker  didn’t bother me though  the battery health is only at    but eh  don’t really care  overall this phone is in good shape ,4
1050,my teen is enjoying it so far  the condition was like new  the charger is generic but does the job  the fingerprint scanner works but not always on the first try  overall  we are happy with the value and performance ,5
1051,the phone looked good  seem to be working as designed  but it is still early  let s see how long it last,4
1052,they sells the phone that was seriously damage and they tried to fix it they still make a lot of money out of it but it’s not worth it  the phone that i got is in a poor quality and the speakers sound like   radio  i bought it for work only so it doesn’t matter how it looks but it works great,2
1053,battery life was shorter than expected however overall i was very pleased with my purchase ,4
1054,it wasn’t worth the hassle to return and could be an honest mistake but rose gold is usually a few dollars less   the box and the order and the sticker on the back all said gold  battery was    kudos for that  looks and works great  i’ll live with the color until i get another ,4
1055,the phone could of been a nice phone but i had to take the simcard from my iphone   and install it into the newer iphone     it caused the   to have all of the same problems that i was replacing the   for   so did me no good to pay the    for a newer phone bc once the sim card was put in it  it became the same phone as the   with all the exact same problems and there are a lot of them   i thought it would of come with a new sim card but since it didn’t i have a newer phone that has all the old phone problems   so was really a waste of my money   idk whose fault this was  i dk if it’s a defect in the i phone   or the    idk how to go about getting a new sim card and who to get it from bc the   didn’t come with one  so the man who sold me the iphone   prob doesn’t owe me one so not sure who i get one from  to put into the    to  fix it  ,1
1056,phone arrived in professionally packed screen protector wrap and nice amazon frustration free packing box   i was impressed to find a phone that looked brand new  not a single scratch or fingerprint  if i had not seen the box it arrived in  i would think it was brand new from apple  this was totally worth it ,5
1057,the only thing i didn’t like was that it came in late because of the bad weather in new york   i was expecting it two days and it came in on march     i ordered it on feb   and i was supposed to get it the     anyway worth the wait   no cracks    packaged great  ,5
1058,i m updating my review  i ve had this refurbished phone for one year  it arrived early  and was working in perfect condition  and looked like new  however  sadly  after one year  exactly  the battery no longer works  and my phone dies when i talk on it for longer than five minutes even when it s fully charged  according to tech republic  the average lifespan of an apple device is four years and   months  even if it s refurbished  for it to last only one year seems like a very short amount of time   i ve contacted the seller to see if they can offer to fix the issue  but the return window has passed        i will update again if there able to offer a resolution     the phone arrived early  worked perfectly well  strong battery  looks like new too ,2
1059,everything went well  but there are no headphones  and a couple of things activated  other than that everything good and i do recommend it ,4
1060,this iphone   was the perfect upgrade from my   year old iphone    it s faster and works perfectly  unfortunately  i had to order the headphone adapter separately  it was included with new iphone   s  but it s not included with the amazon refurb  still a great deal on the phone  but wish i d known about the adapter issue when i bought it  my bad for not doing more research ,4
1061,i love my iphone       it’s beautiful super clean and pristine        battery life and no scratches     sometimes the volume seems a little low in phone calls but it works perfectly     i was hesitant after reading some reviews on here but it was a great buy i’m so happy with this phone     i hope everyone gets as lucky as me     i hope this helps anyone that’s worried about buying and it was unlocked completely and i have metro pcs and i got my android switched over right away       this is a real review no bs,5
1062,i was a bit skeptical on buying this phone since most of the review were bad but to my surprise it arrived in excellent condition and came with a screen protector as well  i’m honestly satisfied with this purchase ,4
1063,overall  this phone is great  just as advertised  i use straighttalk and this phone was easy to switch over  one thing i absolutely hate and is causing me to return the phone is the shutter sound on the camera  everything else was as expected  but as in other reviews i see this phone might have originated from a place where the shutter sound is mandatory  see other similar reviews   i am super not a fan of this  it happens on places where the camera is used as well  like snapchat  made it really weird when i was taking pictures of my notes in the library  i ve tried everything to get it to turn off  but i will be returning this phone and purchasing it directly through my carrier  which is what i was trying to avoid by making this purchase   would ve been perfect except this one feature ,3
1064,i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loved it  i was skeptical about the purchase because it was a refurbished iphone but it worked out great  she’s had no complaints at all  and it came unlocked so i was able to take it to my local merry pcs store and have it activated immediately  i’d purchase this phone again   ,5
1065,i ve only had the phone for several days but it seems fine   what was amazing is that you can transfer via bluetooth all your photos and contacts  everything from your old phone  iphone    to the new phone and then just remove and swap the sim card   done   didn t have to go to the at t place at all ,5
1066,great buy   i bought this for my   year old for getting straight as   it had a tiny scratch on the screen in the upper corner but definitely not too noticeable   so far works great and moves quickly    i’ll be back for another once my other son gets his f up to an a or b lol,5
1067,the phone itself was in great condition  minor scratches around the camera but that’s nearly unavoidable with this model  good battery percentage and a clean imeihowever  it seems as though they are using refurbished phones that originate from japan and korea  those places do not allow you to turn off your camera shutter sound whether your phone is on silent with the media all the way down  or you’re using a third party camera  it always makes that super awkward and annoying shutter sound,3
1068,bought   of these for our boys  typical battery life for apple phones…but not terrible  looked brand new  no issues after a couple months of        yr old wear and tear ,5
1069,all,5
1070,i was scared of buying this product because of negative reviews but took a chance and it turned out fine  looks in new condition  all i did was transfer my t mobile sim card to the iphone   phone and it activated with no problem  happy with my purchase,5
1071,the phone was “refurbished” after getting it checked because battery life has been poor  i was informed they sold me a phone with a defected battery that should not have been sold without replacing the battery  thanks a lot ,1
1072,in comparison to the      and even    iphone   is a step in the right direction by improving the phone in most aspects  the camera is better  battery life is somewhat improved but far from perfect and it s bigger  i have no complaints with the iphone   ,5
1073,the phone that showed up had no scratches or the look of even soft usage  battery runs all day  it feels like a phone right out of the apple box my only complaint is the charging box was broken ,4
1074,i’m not sure what the iphone    us version is  as i currently own the iphone   as well  however this was much smaller than the one i currently own  it’s more of the se edition  not even sure if i received the correct phone  other than that i just gave that phone away to a family member so i’m not sure how they feel about it ,3
1075,the battery life is not that good and the camera is always blurry all the other things work perfectly well,4
1076,the phone is great and in good condition  the seller was really fast to ship out the phone in which that was very helpful  would recommend anybody to order from the shipper ,4
1077,i bought this phone for my daughter and she absolutely loves it ,5
1078,after having the phone for   months with no problem  the phone reset itself and now it has a password on it   im locked out of the phone  i hadn’t put had a password before the reset because it was bought for a   year old ,5
1079,i wrongly believed this iphone was defective   wrote a negative review   due to the corona virus our at t store was closed  the fact that i’d already received a horribly defective phone from another company  and my total lack of knowledge about new iphone technology all lead to this wrong conclusion   cellcow staff were very courteous   promptly shipped me another phone   i want to apologize for my previous rant review   there is nothing wrong with either phone   i will keep one   return the other ,5
1080,purchased for my daughter  she goes iphones like water  i refuse to purchase brand iphone  it s affordable  technically  very well refurbished  no issue at the time  touch screen response is good ,4
1081,the   phones i purchased looked brand new  they all functioned correctly with t mobile and the battery life seems pretty good so far  they are more expensive then some other advertisers but you get what you pay for ,5
1082,good phone but battery life sucks bro renewed pro,5
1083,it came working great  i haven’t used it long but everything seems to be working fine  a lot of these reviews discouraged me before buying but i don’t have any regrets  will be returning tho because the   is pretty small and i’d like to have the plus ,4
1084,literally no regrets  the phone was in absolute perfect condition  with no scratches and a    battery life  the phone is so much better than i thought it would be  thank you so much ,5
1085,fine for the price i m happy with it   the battery lasts about   hours though  i used to have an android  which can last about twice longer ,4
1086,i ve had bad experiences purchasing phones off amazon over the years  however  recently they ve been doing a bang up job sending me fully working products  i don t know if i m lucky or they upped their standards  whatever the case maybe  i got the package a whopping two days early and the setup was business as usual  would recommend other key features   it comes with an iphone charger and push pin for the sim card slot p  s  i am a t mobile user ,5
1087,we don’t use face recognition or fingerprint recognition and because it’s an apple iphone and every time apple  does an ios upgrade  they further trash out the battery life and that’s in apple thing not the phones fault ,5
1088,the phone worked fine for about a week but after that the touch screen stopped working  even after a trip to apple we got nothing they stated the entire screen would have to be replaced for a price of more than the phone costed,1
1089,works fine ,5
1090, i would like to see better quality  the posted selling picture on amazon doesn’t justify the received iphone  i am kind disappointed because it had a lot of scratches and dents   i ordered previously a year ago from a  competition ebayonline and they items nearly perfect looks  however i feel misled with the  appetizing pictures because there wasn’t the once from original product ,3
1091,phone in good shape  battery at    health which isn’t great but it’s workable  slight smudge in the screen pixels  oval shape  about  “ x    ”  but very faint and hard to notice   was worried the smudge would grow darker with time but so far so good  if this phone maintains its current performance i’ll be very satisfied with my purchase  will update if there are issues ,4
1092,the phone is perfectly in working condition with no cosmetic wear or tear  i was really impressed when i received the phone as it does looks like a new iphone  i have received the phone on time and the setup worked fine without any issues  i would recommend anyone who is interested to purchase ,5
1093,camera is blurry,3
1094,something is different about this phone  but over all it works great  but i think the touch screen might be less sensitive  and a couple other tiny glitches here and there i can’t think of right now  the difference is so minuscule  it’s worth buying this phone ,4
1095,arrived fast very good condition and i use it with my refurbished apple watch  i got this for my daughter at christmas and it s still working great ,4
1096,                    the media could not be loaded                 ,5
1097,kiddo loves it   no issues,5
1098,i’ve had my refurbished iphone   for a little over a month and so far so good  very satisfied and the cost was just right  i would order a refurbished phone in the future when needed  it was delivered in ample time ,4
1099,if you’re looking for the review  this is it  i have never been more cheated on than i was buying this product from this seller  i thought  wow    reviews with only a small percentage of bad experiences  what can go wrong  i received the phone only for it to not be what i expected but also for it to not even have all its original parts  the back was poorly glued on from whoever jumped in its bones and took what they wanted  the thing wouldn’t even come on  it just kept blinking an apple logo  someone could say sure  you just gotta download this and hold that button for x amount of seconds but why do i need to do that  i was told it would turn on with good battery   didn’t even do that i am very disappointed and i feel like i got scammed  i don’t understand how these items aren’t verified by amazon but this seller is just trying to get rid of a bunch of old  glorified iphones that don’t work  don’t waste your time  buy from apple themselves or directly from amazon  don’t trust the   party seller unless you need it for parts and even then i wouldn’t  i’d give this     stars if i could ,1
1100,this phone works great refurbished  the only complaint is the battery life  only    max left after its original use   but all things considered  this phone was a fantastic value  works great  and i can deal with needing to charge it once a day  probably still cheaper to replace the battery than try to buy the same phone brand new ,4
1101,bought this phone to replace an older android due to purchasing the apple watch   still in a learning curve  about the settings   i did not receive an instruction manual and the ones online are not too helpful   however  my biggest concern is the battery seems to drain rather quickly    maybe this is quirk with all apple phones   overall  i am pleased with the phone ,5
1102,phone shipped a day sooner than scheduled  when i took it out of the box  i thought it was brand new  i charged it up and set it next to my old iphone   and everything auto transferred  updates processed and the phone works flawlessly  i’m so impressed  and i was worried about buying a used phone  battery is well over     great purchase so far  it came with a   day warranty  if any issues develop i’ll report with an updated review  but i anticipate all will be good ,5
1103,no me agrado no tener screen protector at the moment to  save the screen from litter línea for the poket or somethink like that,4
1104,i have had this iphone for about   weeks  there were no marks  scuffs or scratches on it at all  transferring data from my other phone to this one was pretty easy  the phone works great with long battery life and is much faster than my other iphone ,5
1105,i got my phone today  iphone       and was able to get my data  contacts  text messages  etc moved from my note   to my iphone   without any problem  i’m giving a   star rating based on the condition of the phone which was excellent   it came in mint condition  i’ll give another review based on battery performance battery review  love  love  love this phone      it charges within about   hours and can go about a day and half on one charge  i do play games  shop  use the internet a lot plus quite a bit of texting throughout the day  very happy with this phone  ,5
1106,after about three months from purchase battery began to give us problems  the battery life was weakening  after about four months died quickly  phone was hot to the touch  the phone stopped working powering on that six months,3
1107,i gave this phone a   only because the seller is not describing it properly   it is a gsm phone and  as such  does not work on verizon or sprint the same way a verizon or sprint phone will work   those carriers use cdma phones  so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage   it worked in as far as i could get it activated to make calls  receive texts and be fully functional  but only in certain areas   i had an     an iphone   before that  both with verizon   both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend s house   never once lost service in   years   then i bought this phone   had service fine until i got to his house   then my phone said  no service    it did this repeatedly for a few days every time i went to his house   stayed that way the whole time i was there even though my boyfriend s verizon iphone   worked in the same house at the same time   never lost service   i called verizon   they said this phone was a t mobile phone   is a gsm phone   explained that if i want the same level of coverage i had before i need an unlocked phone that was originally a verizon phone so that it is a cdma phone   i guess an original sprint phone would work  too  since those are cdma phones   i told amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or cdma ,1
1108,like new  great price great product,5
1109,i upgraded from an iphone    to an iphone   after the announcement of the iphone   price drop  because with   they finally stopped supporting the    all i do on my phone is check email  chat on telegram  take photos and watch youtube  i m not a power user  so the main difference i noticed was everything became more responsive  faster  and the battery lasts much longer  the transfer process was pretty easy through itunes  no complaints  i stuck with apple out of sheer convenience  and i ll probably continue to stay with apple as long as they don t remove the fingerprint reader in future models ,5
1110,price for this used iphone   was very good  phone itself is good and reliable  used by elder person only as a phone  most off the apps were deleted on purpose not to confuse   years old user ,5
1111,i purchased iphone     fully unlocked for my oldest one  he uses without phone service he likes it because he can join the group chat through imessage with his classmates and i like it because i can monitor his usages the phone seems working decent for a used one i am planning to get another one for my deaf child as well  because iphone has a feature to pair hearing devices directly stream  phone calls  movies  music  and etc  its the best for bilateral ci implants ,5
1112,ordered for christmas present  product had   day warranty and literally worked for   days before losing functionality  company will not help  honestly feels like a scam ,1
1113,just got phone today  it turns on but i haven’t set it up yet  noticeable face and body blemishes which is disappointing but so far seems like it will function ok ,3
1114,bought this for my   yo son  he was over the moon excited as this was a step up from his last iphone  he loves it  no problems so far and we have had it about   months now,5
1115,the description is accurate,4
1116,i’ve been using a   with   for   years and it finally died for good  so  i upgraded to the   and let me tell you this is huge upgrade for me  it’s the exact same feel and look but better  the display is nicer  fingerprint scanner is faster  and the over speed is better  when phone came it’s actually looked brand new  no scraps or scratches or worn down buttons  you forget that it was a refurbished phone  so far     for me ,5
1117,as soon as i saw the phone  i noticed something was off  the screen just didn t look or feel like it fit the phone  there was dirt a dark substance caked between the edge of the screen and the frame all around the phone  there was a scratch gouge over the front camera lens and a deeper gouge on the upper left side of the screen  the metal frame connecting the front and back panels was scratched the entire way around as well  literally as if it had been rubbed on pavement on every edge  i bought this because it is currently the only listing i can find for a regular iphone    after reading the other reviews  i didn t even try turning it on  returning immediately ,2
1118,iphone   arrived in great condition  battery life wasn’t as expected but seller was extremely helpful and communicative in resolving the issue  promptly reimbursing me for the cost of a new battery  would recommend this seller ,5
1119,used  phone was great  came out the box  silent  vibrate switch  was broken  went into silent mode on and off automatically when ever it wanted to all by itself  missed calls  messages  facetime without even knowing while still in my pocket until i checked it when i had free time while at work or out  only had it for a week and a half then sold it to somebody else  just bought an iphone   yesterday instead ,3
1120,upgrade from    no longer getting ios updatesexceeds basic phone needs  smart phonebudget i phone  significantly less expensive than the current or more recent models ,4
1121,i’ve had the phone for two weeks without any issue  the phone and the accessories came neatly packaged  phone included a temporary protective cover  front and rear glass appear to be new   the only cosmetic flaws are a few scuffs on the metal bezel  i would consider that to be expected for a used phone  not a big deal for the flaws are unseen once the phone is in a case  i would definitely buy again when my wife or i are in store for a better phone ,5
1122,awesome how you can get a great phone for cheap here  i took off one star because the was a small nick on one of the edges but otherwise it looked pretty good ,4
1123,arrived ahead  of time looked like new  working ok so far ,4
1124,i was really nervous when getting this because i kept on seeing mixed reviews  but when i got it i was very pleased  it works perfectly fine and it’s an amazing upgrade from the    i went to my phone carrier the same day to set up the sim card and it all went smoothly ,5
1125,there was nothing i did not like from this iphone  it was gorgeous  not a scratch on it and looked and sounded brand new  i love it  and it is going from my home all the way to africa  to a young man who needed a phone  he just received it and he is thrilled his old phone was dying and could not keep a charge  i was just thrilled when i opened the box  wow again thank you ,5
1126,i upgraded from a   iphone   to the   with   and i appreciate the increase size and storage  transfer of my data was easy  just put the   next to the   and the transfer was seamless  all of my apps were transferred which made me very happy  i recommend this iphone and the vendor  it came with an iphone plugin charger   cable  the phone was charged when it arrived  i used the sim pin from my   to move my sim card from the   to the    although it didn’t come in an official apple box  it was well packaged and looks brand new ,5
1127,the phone fit the description that was given  no faulty hardware or anything ,4
1128,excellent purchase for my   old daughter  i didn’t get a pager until i was   years old  things have def changed,4
1129,the volume is low  battery is damaged  and phone cannot take pictures properly ,4
1130,if your looking for a iphone cheap these are the guys to buy it from   percent like and will buy fro them again like wtf   for an iphone you would be stupid not to buy  and this is a real buyers comment btw add me on playstation   blxntgreen for more evidence,5
1131,i finally had to replace my iphone se after i botched a shattered screen replacement  i m not the type to buy into the latest model phone and i also knew that i liked touchid  seeing that the series   was the last to use the feature  i bit the bullet and upgraded  not having the     jack anymore didn t bother me as much as i thought it would  it shipped promptly and now i m enjoying a iphone   that works like new  but cost me way less  thanks ,5
1132,phone is alright but get too hot when i am on facetime giving me notifications that it’s too hot,4
1133,the phone i received is garbage  it sort of worked for the first   days  but by       months it s unusable  it won t stay connected to verizon lte network  the charge port is way too loose to change the phone  i got ripped off by this amazon vendor  if i could give   stars i would  waste of money i have replaced the sim card with a new one  but that makes no difference  the cellular connection repeatedly goes from   bars to no service without me moving around  i cannot make a phone call without the connection dropping  the battery lasts takes less than an hour if i use safari on a wifi connection  if i am using the phone  and the charge port is so loose  charging the phone is unreliable  attempted to get a resolution from the seller  but the seller hides behind their   day return policy  never again will i purchase a phone like this  better off dealing directly with apple or verizon  seller s like this buy used phones cheap or take on trade on phones  they clean them up physically and wipe the ios  it s a crap shoot if you get a decent phone  they are scamming people ,1
1134,came early and works well  the condition was good not pristine but good  a few small blemishes here and there  works well and i would recommend ,4
1135,in the end  this was a headache  at first it seemed to be okay  but when i went to check battery health  it was below the    that they committed to  i asked for a replacement battery  and i had to keep reminding them until it finally came after   month  but it was worthless  they sent a battery that did not keep charge for very long  so finally  since i had already had all my software installed etc   i just bought a new battery     added to the price  had that been the only thing i would have been ok  but a few weeks ago  after just   months of use  the wifi stopped working  so now i m buying an altogether different unit  in other words  i was penny wise and dollar stupid a much better deal seems to be buying not the  renewed  but rather the  renewed premium   which comes with a   year warranty and an battery guaranteed to be at    or more  but you can probably end up being unlucky there too ,1
1136,my son saved up all of his money to buy his first phone  we decided on this iphone   that was refurbished by an amazon authorized retailer  the phone came with a   day warranty  it was supposed to have a battery with    life or higher  the phone arrived with    battery  that should have been a red flag  either way my son was excited and the phone worked  eventually the phone stopped working and i reached out to the seller for some assistance and they told me that since it was   days after the purchase there was nothing they could do  i could under stand if it was   months after the purchase but it was still only a few days out of warranty  so      if you buy this phone dont expect any help after   days  even if its   days they will make you feel like you got robbed  i do not recommend this seller or their bogus refurbished phones and horrible customer service,1
1137,almost like new,5
1138,i was a bit worried that it would come with scuffs and scratches but the phone looks completely brand new  works perfectly too  battery life at     the phone also arrived a few days earlier than the expected delivery date  very happy with my purchase ,5
1139,very pleased with the quality and condition of the phone   a few scratches around the top of the phone  by my case covers them  my phone even arrived a day earlier than expected   even with a hurricane looming  my new phone was easy to set up and it have all of the info from my old phone transferred  would definitely recommend this seller  the even included a screen protector ,5
1140,i’m a verizon prepaid customer and wanted to upgrade phones  i had a little trouble trying to use ebay  so i came to amazon and this was by far the best experience i had with ordering this phone  it came the next day after i ordered it and i only needed to put my sim card from my iphone   into the new iphone   and it connected right to the network  i didn’t have to go in the store or call a number or anything  wonderful phone upgrade  it’s much better than the old one  would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade a verizon prepaid phone ,5
1141,battery life    come with charger cable and charging block  not original  phone works well ,4
1142,personal uses ,5
1143,i know i wasgetting a refurbished phone but i didn t expect scratches on the screen when it came out of the box ,4
1144,phone was delivered on time  miner scuffs on the screen  it’s to be expected  decent charging cable  phone was packaged well  over all i’m happy,4
1145,my phone was delivered in a timely manner and came in nice packaging  no scuffs or scratches on the screen or outside of the phone  i’m very content with the condition of this phone and it was easy to set up with the existing sim card i had in my old phone through verizon  i will never buy a brand new phone from the store again  i do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port ,4
1146,this phone was for my son  he says everything works great and he hasn’t had any problems with it,5
1147,bom,4
1148,i received,5
1149,i m super happy with my iphone    i purchased mines from  axe mobility  and have to say i m very impressed  everything was carefully boxed and i got a new charger in a and wire that was individually packaged  even though it wasn t a apple charger i don t really care  the phone works great and it looked flawless ,5
1150,works like new batter life good  volume slightly lower then expected but not a big deal   worth it ,4
1151,i ve had it about a month and it s working as it should ,3
1152,the battery dies on you even when it’s at    doesn’t hold a charge the backlight will go all the way down on you  i have to constantly keep it on the charger ,3
1153,i m almozt   years old and my parents said if i wanted a phone  i had to buy it  so i saved and saved  and my dad helped me find this phone for a great price  i love my phone so much  i was super excited when it came and it was in perfect condition  i am not regretting at all getting a referbished phone and it is definitely worth the money  plus my parents like it because they can link all kinds of security apps and location stuff with it   ha  ha ,5
1154,worked on sprint and t mobile out of the box  good condition,4
1155,phone is functional lack on info if parts are all original or has it been repaired before a couple of scratches,4
1156,phone was in great shape and very fast delivery,5
1157,the charging cord didn t work and i had to purchase one separately   the ear piece for using the telephone was blocked or not functioning correctly and i had to make all calls on speaker phone or with a headset   the seller has offered to replace the phone and i m currently waiting on the replacement ,3
1158,this seller advertised a  fully functional product  but sent me an iphone with a battery that couldn t last more than   minutes of talk time on a fully charged battery  then after i returned the item on time  i dropped it off at a ups location and got a receipt for it on       and the last day to return it was        this seller charged me a restocking fee of      with a false excuse that i did not return it on time ,1
1159,there is a minor but long scratch on the front face near the top of the phone  the scratch is visible and can be felt with a finger nail  it also came with a screen protector that didn t even fit the phone correctly that i took off immediately  i m still giving it   starts because it s a decent price for the phone  everything else was great ,4
1160,i can t speak for all renewed items  but i hit the lottery with this one   it looked brand new  with no obvious blemishes   the battery life indicated that it was nearly perfect   and i ve noticed no issues with apple authenticity   this is a iphone   that was nearly perfect that was put into the  renewed  category  renewed  is a affordable way to upgrade or replace a phone while on a budget     stars,5
1161,battery isn’t the best  but it works well for my needs  works with tmobile,4
1162,had a little trouble transferring everything from old phone to new  but i think it was operator errors   seems to be working fine ,4
1163,the phone was in good condition and my son was pleased with it until the battery died less than six months after receiving it  the seller said it was a cheap fix  only       but if that were the case  why didn’t he put a new battery in it before he sold it to me  it cost my son       very disappointed ,3
1164,great phone  however it arrived with a scratch imperfection on the front of the phone s screen  but for the price point i still believe it was worth purchasing ,4
1165,el teléfono aparenta estar en buena condición física pero la batería es pésima el celular se apaga todo el tiempo,4
1166,electronic deals was very helpful and patient with me  i had to return two phones  both with audio issues  but this third one has worked wonderfully  i gave them four stars because i had to return multiple times but otherwise very good ,4
1167,is good but the color of the lcd is kind of pink is not like the original,4
1168,it came in perfect condition and just as described   got this for my daughter’s birthday in may and she has been using it ever since with no issue  took about a week to ship but it came as scheduled  very pleased and would buy again  ,5
1169,after reading some negative reviews  i was a bit skeptical  i went with my gut and purchased the phone  i do have to say that for the price  this phone is amazing  mine looks brand new with no damage on the front or back apart from small paint chipping  it charges fine and lasts the normal time  setup is fine and when i put in my tmobile sim it worked in seconds,5
1170,first time purchasing a used phone  after charging to     highest it will charge   the phone was turned off for the day  when turned back on  the power went to     the battery simply won’t hold a charge  no apps were added  no photos taken  in fact  i deleted apps that were not necessary ,4
1171,i ordered the phone on saturday and it arrived on thursday which was very fast  when it it arrived  i took it out of the package and was amazed that it was in almost new condition it was a slight scuff on the bottom  but it wasn’t a deal breaker for me  it’s working perfectly right now and the battery life is amazing  i definitely recommend ,5
1172,bought for my grandson  he loves it and figured it out adding apps and whatever else he thought he needed  said it’s was to use ,4
1173,just like new  i was very hesitant about buying a used phone  especially after reading all the reviews  maybe i’m the lucky one  but this was exactly like new  even when i brought it to verizon they were impressed  because it was as if it was brand new  this was a gift  so my only disappointment was that it didn’t come in an iphone case  which it said it wouldn’t in the description  i am very pleased and my daughter has had it for almost   months ,5
1174,iphone was a gift i was not sure what to expect but it was great buy in price compared to others functional looks nice sleek in great condition,5
1175,the product says it comes with a sim card remover and it does not  so you will have to prepare for that  other than minor cosmetic damage the phone runs really well  if possible would probably rate with       stars but it’s really not a bad product at all,5
1176,this phone arrived in pristine condition  all features of the phone work perfectly the seller packaged the phone perfectly  priced the phone fairly  described its condition accurately  and then shipped the phone quickly i would purchase this phone again from this seller ,5
1177,yes the shutter sound can’t be turned off but by just using live mode to take photos that is resolved  the phone was for my wife and she likes the shutter sound  who knows why   so zero problem either way  phone arrived indistinguishable from new  shiny and scratch free  setup was easy  sim card from old phone worked perfectly  charged extremely fast and battery seems to last a long time  we added the extended warranty  a   phone for less than    can’t be beat ,5
1178,product came on the earlier side of the time frame  i was super worried after i read the negative comments about the seller and product  iphone     but the phone arrived well and set up was easy and have not had any problems since  i got it almost a week ago  took maybe     minutes to set up the phone  i am happy  i am a frugal buyer and it hurt my stomach to make that purchase  however there was intention in needing it  happy with the product ,5
1179,iphone had a defective battery within   days reached out to the company they said they would send me a replacement however not without receiving the one they gave me which creates an obvious problem i can’t transfer for my data until i get the replacement,2
1180,i bought this refurbished phone for my son as his first cell phone   it was in perfect condtion with no scratches  everything functions as it should   and great battery life ,5
1181,replaced my partner s older iphone  meets expectations and works great ,5
1182,good phone   no problems purchased in november  ,5
1183,this is a replacement unit  it works but i had some kinks i had to work on via apple,4
1184,it’s exactly as described and it came in earlier than expected  it’s a good cell phone for my aunt  she loves it  thanks ,5
1185,um idk i mean it looks brand new and has no noticeable scratches or defects and every thing works as it should so i’m happy with this investment only thing i can complain about is not getting the   plus for only like   or so bucks more,5
1186,very nice phone  came almost brand new  it has a very small scratch on the screen but i can’t even tell it’s there  no scratches on back or anywhere else  it was fully unlocked and works well with my service   cricket wireless  i upgraded from a   and my only complaint is the battery life not being much better than the    however i know batteries tend to die down with age  the phone does charge pretty fast  came with its own charger  and it works perfectly  would buy it again,5
1187,had about   or   deep noticeable scratches along the edges of the screen  came with a screen protector to try to cover up the blemishes  other than that  everything works great  it isn’t perfect  the fingerprint reader might freeze a few times  but nothing that makes me not like the phone  came with a non branded charger which charges faster than the original apple charger  no headphones  its decent  for the price  you can’t beat it ,4
1188,it was in super great condition felt like it was  new  even though it was renewed the packing was alright  phone came in fully charged and factory reset the battery life was at    which wasn t a big deal again this was a renewed iphone   super happy with the price and the condition,5
1189,good phone ,4
1190,the refurbishing on this phone is terrible  i bought this phone   months ago or so and immediately noticed something was off  it seemed like the screen was rising up but ignored it and assumed it was just a quirk of having a refurbished phone  about a month later i noticed the corners of the screen beginning to chip and after that a couple larger cracks appeared from the smallest drops and i had a case on it the entire time  the screen then began peeling off and at first what i assumed was a tempered glass protective covering turned out to be the screen itself  upon closer look there are many things off about this phone like the microphone and camera  please don’t buy ,1
1191,it was okay came with a crack on the screen though,3
1192,i got the iphone   in and it looked new and it’s functions are excellent  battery seems pretty good though i am on the internet a lot so that always drains a battery down  if i leave the phone idle  the battery will last longer  that’s a no brainer  so i have no complaints,5
1193,needed a replacement and was shocked to find that we could buy this at such a great price   the battery life was around    and the phone appeared to be brand new otherwise   this is definitely the way to go when buying for those who may not take care of an expensive phone under a   contract ,5
1194,i activated this phone a couple days ago and so far it s been what i expected  the one issue i have found is that on snapchat you have to turn the volume down  open the snap and then turn the volume back up to listen to it but this is probably an issue with snapchat rather then the phone  would recommend ,4
1195,these phones require a special sim card   something you won t know unless you spend three days online with your service provider troubleshooting the phone  i paid    at one boost store  wrong sim card  bought another one at a full boost dealer and the card was     but required another    to activate change my plan  oh  but it didn t end there  the boost agent didn t enter my address  phone number or email address   all things my internet security relies on  it s been a week now and i m still trying to get apple to release my password on this phone so i can get into my internet accounts   which are my business  i have two factor authentication activated and that relies on a phone that is properly working  no idea how much it s cost me in lost time  customers  and money customer service is poor to nonexistent as they believe once they sell you the phone it s up to you to figure out how to activate  what sim card     to buy and so on  they do not include a manual  or even a one page quickstart facts about your phone  cost to them  pennies to print out the simple facts you need to get started   it s a nightmare  unless you like spending time with your provider s tech team for hours  do not buy this phone ,1
1196,the phone itself was in pristine condition initially  i have only had it for   weeks and the battery now overheats and stops working so i am unable to make calls or send texts  about a week ago my fingerprint button went wonky   it still worked but opening the phone took more tries than when i first purchased the phone  this is definitely a refurbished phone   over all i would give the quality a c  ,5
1197,hi get the phone on time so far so good  only the battery don’t stay long otherwise is good ,4
1198,this phone came in the mail in perfect condition  with little to no scratches  used my t mobile sim card and works perfectly  i was apprehensive to buy a phone on amazon  but it turned out to be great highly recommend     ,5
1199,i love my phone it can almost looking brand new i   percent recommend to buy this product,4
1200,so far i’m happy with my new iphone    with one exception  it came with a non compatible charger  how am i supposed to charge up a brand new phone with the wrong charger  good thing i had my existing iphone   charger  my point is  if they say they’re going to send you a compatible charger  then send one  then i found out the hard way that my sim card in my iphone   is not compatible with my iphone    and this phone did not come with a sim card  i suggest you read the product description thoroughly before you decide to purchase ,3
1201,i love my new phone  the battery life lasts tremendously longer than my old iphone se  it runs smoothly  charges quickly and stays charged  and is the perfect size  i highly recommend buying this phone  i have already recommended to friends looking to get new phones  unbeatable for what you get ps mine even came with a charger chord and charger wall outlet ,5
1202,within the first week we could tell it had a old battery in it  won’t keep charge longer than a hour and the battery health won’t even read it’s so bad  overall phone is great just upset we have to spend more money to replace the battery right off the bat ,3
1203,it is great with many features  some of which i have not used yet   still learning  but satisfied so far ,4
1204,i thought the phone was a great purchase until i tried to use the camera and it would not focus  all the videos and pictures are blurry  i’m taking the phone in to have the camera replaced  i get it’s refurbished but i expected it to work properly ,5
1205,i bought a renewed   and it is just perfect   for the amount i paid  i am so happy ,5
1206,it came with issues  does phone has difficulty connecting to wifi  i have to restart the phone often and that is very annoying  the phone came dirty  they didn’t even bother to clean the outside of the cell that i guess that was the same poor job they did to “clean” the inside of the phone,4
1207,nice iphone got it next day,5
1208,works perfectly for my   year old  looked new  but came with aftermarket charger  which was new in the box  ,4
1209,bought this renewed i phone   and paid a little extra to make sure it was a verizon phone  just left the verizon store where they switched the sim card from my old to the renewed phone only to find out that it is not a verizon phone  wasted time  the phone itself was nice and clean  no scratches etc  that s why i gave it a star but the seller is not good  there was no sim card removal card either even though in the product description it said that there was going to be one  sending the phone back today  very disappointed,2
1210,phone i was in good condition  the charger it came with didn’t work  the battery life is ok  it does take forever to charge ,4
1211,the item description said something like  looks like new if held at arm s length   the phone looks like new even when looked at from the closest distance  shipping was way faster than advertised  and the battery is at    maximum capacity   great stuff  i am super happy with this seller  thank you very much ,5
1212,the price was fair and the phone is like new  i purchased this phone   as it was an upgrade from my   and i did not want to pay    or    for a new phone  also switched carriers for a    savings  all good ,5
1213,i needed a new phone didn’t think i would trust buying a iphone from amazon  so i gave it a try for the first time and let me tell you i was so happy with my purchase    so worth it works great had no problems ,5
1214,based on reviews i ve read  it seems that refurbished phones are hit and miss  and that makes sense  not all used phones were treated equally our experience with this renewed iphone   has been great   the phone really is in excellent condition  works like new  looks almost new  but costs half the price  battery came with    battery life  which is still an  a  in my book i d recommend giving it a try  we are very satisfied with the phone ,5
1215,haven’t had one problem or disappointment yet ,5
1216,works fine,5
1217,i had android for   years  samsung specifically   and i got sick of it so i bought this iphone  i love it  i will buy a house phone before i buy and other android put that on my life,5
1218,i’ve had this phone for   weeks  and no problems so far   it came early  no scratches and    battery life ,5
1219,while the battery maximum capacity was a little low for my liking       it was pretty close to what they mentioned it would be       it was truly unlocked  got a tracfone sim  moved my number over from verizon and activated without an issue  i could not spot a scratch on the phone  it was clean ,5
1220,my phone came with a lil crack on the black but other than that its a good phone,4
1221,this phone does not hold a charge  i charged it to    then took it off the charger and the battery drop to    in less than two minutes  in the setting it says that the battery life is severely degraded and has to be replaced  i thought that i was buying a amazon certified phone  nowhere in the description of the dis it say anything about the phone battery needing to be replaced  i wouldn’t have bought it if it did  very disappointed,1
1222,works like a champ  haven t used the face recognition and haven t had it long enough to comment on the battery life ,4
1223,the battery discharge really fast don’t last two hours i don’t know what can i do because i need charge every two hours,2
1224,i put finger print an needed passcode an i forgot i gotta keep it charged if i was gone forget passcode i constantly used the finger print smh my mistake i forgot the code haven t even switched the phone over for service,3
1225,it’s a great phone  my other iphone was small and broken  this is slightly bigger so that’s nice  it works great  you have to sign for the package  so be home when it’s delivered or they won’t leave it  i’m using it now to write this  so i can tell you it works great  when i got it i just popped out the sim card from my old phone  so i personally didn’t have to go to the phone store  maybe you will have to go in  maybe not  i’m not sure  but my experience was great  thanks ,5
1226,great phone   i generally don’t write reviews  i needed a new phone but couldn’t  afford a new phone price   i looked  online for  weeks for a refurbished phone at a good price with good reviews i love this phone   it functions great and  it looks brand new   i am very satisfied ,5
1227,great product  great seller    responds in a timely fashion ,5
1228,my   old son needed a new phone and every store we went to was literally out of iphones  sooo i checked on amazon and found a refurbished iphone he actually liked for a decent price  i was really worried until the package arrived and we opened it up     he’s had this phone for almost two weeks now and it has been great  i am so happy i decided to purchase this iphone  will be purchasing in the future ,5
1229,i knew that a renewed product would mean that the battery had some use to it  and i m finding that to be true  no matter if i disable bluetooth  wifi  etc   it just doesn t last long  just be aware  physically the product was flawless and came nicely packed ,4
1230,i bought this refurbished phone for my   old son  the phone arrived quick and looks like new  so far it functions well with no issues  ,4
1231,i needed to replace my old iphone   because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera   the iphone   was priced right and i m very happy with it   the hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone   my previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years   i ve had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that i have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them ,5
1232,great buy  iphone     still up and running good  had one body drop mark and i dropped it as well adding another but once a case is on it’s irrelevant and unseen  overall i’m glad i purchased through this seller  will buy again soon i’m sure ,5
1233,son broke his screen on his   year old iphone    bought him this iphone    great phone in like new condition  activated easily with a backup restore from the old phone and a sim card swap  battery health is    and better than his old phone  great purchase ,4
1234,i’ve had this phone for about   days now  so far haven’t had any problems  i thought it would be more scratched up but it wasn’t  very clean  came with a long charger which is nice ,5
1235,i received the phone today  the whole front of the screen was scratchedit was a birthday presentvery disappointed,1
1236,i bought this with some skepticism but was pleasantly surprised  the maximum capacity was marked at    when i checked  but it charges to    so i’m thinking it’s a small glitch  everything works the way it was supposed to though  so far  anyway  it did come to me with a bunch of minor scratches ,4
1237,perfect phone i wander sometimes if the speaker and bluetooth works,4
1238,beautiful phone  i went from a   plus to iphone    i was very hesitant based on reviews but i was delighted when i got the phone  not a single blemish or dent or scratch  i was able to transfer my metro pcs sim car within minutes  so worth the money ,5
1239,this product is extremely efficient and came ready and able to use immediately and has been perfectly reliable ever since and couldn’t be happier with my choice of purchase ,5
1240,came in a plain box with a non apple charger block with a new apple lightning cord for charging  phone is in excellent condition  no scratches anywhere  easy to set up  volume  is nice and loud and screen snd pictures and video taken performance according to expectation,5
1241,purchased this  renewed fully unlocked  rose gold iphone   for my   year old daughter and it works like a brand new iphone    i wanted to wait to write review for a few weeks to see if this phone would still be operating and it is just like a brand new one it s totally unlocked for all carriers  just make certain to purchase an sd card before trying to add to your cellular carrier of choice ,5
1242,bought it for my mom  the iphone was unlocked so it was easy to install and activate  the battery life is good after a full charge it lasted more than a day  the phone as described as it is no scratches or any problems ,5
1243,good phone  battery was lower than normal though  has     battery life of a new phone ,4
1244,so far  so good   no issues this far with the phone,4
1245,i love my new phone  it is exactly as described in the listing  i will never purchase a brand new model when the renewed models are just as good and much less expensive  if you didn t know it was an older model you would think it was the latest being offered   no scratches no noticeable defects and battery level is very good ,5
1246,fast shipping   honest   reliable product info    would buy from them again  thanks ,5
1247,the seller sold me a damage  phone did not hold a charge and it was not refurbish and i still haven’t got my refund ,1
1248,the phone arrived well packaged on time and in perfect condition  even on very close inspection i couldn t find  any flaws at all  it s like a new phone  the packaging was better than i expected and the phone was well protected  i couldn t be happier with the purchase ,5
1249,the battery health is    and it lose charge quickly,4
1250,need to use with a sim card but as now it is working just fine ,5
1251,when i call people it randomly cuts out because they say it sound like i’m holding my finger over the microphone when nothing is in the way  other than that the phone has be good for battery wise and it has the latest update so it’s a good phone to get ,3
1252,every time this phone is in the sun it says it’s overheating and i am not able to use the phone when this happens  the flashlight is broken  doesn’t give the option to even turn on which is an inconvenience  i used to use flashlight often on every iphone i’ve had  i deduct one start each for these major inconveniences,3
1253,love the phone but how do you get rid of the floaty white button thing,5
1254,the price was great  i checked around and amazon was the best price,5
1255,i bought this phone for my mom and i did not know what trouble she’s been having with this phone for the weeks that she has had it the phone would have such a delay when trying to open a app  she can’t even hang up the phone when she’s done she has a press the screen multiple times its is disaster  the only thing that honestly works properly is the home button and siri   now i lost out on    on the phone that barely works for my mom i’m very disappointed  luckily she’s going to get my xr with no issues whatsoever  be warned you get what you paid for with these phones  it’s will not work properly the way you want  ,2
1256,battery     everything seems good as new ,4
1257,can i trade this i phone   for a i phone   plus can not get it to ring on incoming calls  go to settings and it rings nice and loud but does not ring at calls and it is to small a screen for   year old and also can i trade it in for an   plus  help,3
1258,good  clean and neat phone  well packaged  main features working as expected  the only shortcoming is the short battery life which seems to last less than a day ,4
1259,i ordered three phones  of these one for me and the other two for my two daughters and let me tell you that they work fine they came in this nice box with their chargers i’m really satisfied with them they have been working great so i am happy,5
1260,it was great packaging with a charger and a chord  very clean  gave a feeling of new purchase what i didn t like   when opened  battery was almost at      there was no indication that the phone was gcm unlocked   i had purchased gcm unlocked  ,5
1261,great price for the phone  however the battery was bad  it s a great phone for my kid after i replaced the battery ,4
1262,it’s okay so far  i feel like the battery might be draining kinda fast but i will come back and update,5
1263,unfortunately the phone has been returned to seller  it was a charcoal colored phone i received but the order said space gray   this was not the reason i returned it however  as soon as i received it   i installed a tempered glass screen protector  which worked very poorly in getting responses from the touch screen   idid not realize that this was the fault of the screen protector until i had received authorization for a return  just prior to boxing it up  i removed the protector and found out it now worked perfectly   oh well live and learn   i will be repairing my older iphone   plus and using that until i can can buy another phone hopefully in the next   months ,3
1264,i read a lot of reviews prior to ordering   since i didnt want to get ripped off  i ordered this phone  expecting to possibly having to send it back  it came almost   days  earlier then amazon saying  all the buttons work great  no scratches  the first day i thought the battery was weak  but battery life status told me it was a    i must have not had it fully charged    havent noticed any issues at all very happy about my purchase  will try to write another review down the road seeing how its holding up ,5
1265,charging port on the phone had a fault charging cable would not stick so phone doesn’t hold charge poor battery life,1
1266,i ordered   iphone   s from this vendor at a good price the phones i received work well  but after using them a while we discovered that we were unable to disable the rather loud camera shutter sound   this is apparently a  feature  of japanese market iphones due to local laws   sure enough  when we find the model code in the settings  these are japanese models  even though we are in the u s there was no indication that we would receive foreign model phones in the listing  nor how they may differ from us distributed phones   the listing indicates that the phones are  for at t   which i believe is a u s  only network provider this is somewhat annoying ,3
1267,bought as a gift for my mom and she loved it  so far it’s going good   hope so it doesn’t get any fault,4
1268,it was time to upgrade from my iphone   and i took a chance with this renewed iphone    it looks like new  works great and i’ve found no problems so far  battery still has    life so better than expected ,5
1269,so far so good   ordered an iphone   unlocked  currently using metro pcs  no problems occurred so far  not sure how everyone else is having problems  it’s great quality  practically brand new  no scam so ignore the other reviews,5
1270,it works ,5
1271,this is my sons   cellphone  may not be the latest   greatest to others  but it is to him  he loves it   of course pre teen having his own phone   score  definitely recommend,5
1272,good seller and good product  just as it described and as expected when received ,5
1273,the iphone battery is     the touch screen is faulty  doesnt always work fine  i cant slide up the control center  not an iphone like new,4
1274,this phone is in perfect condition and fully functional  very satisfied with my purchase   the reviews are either hit or miss  so i took a gamble but was prepared and committed to returning repeatedly if necessary  glad i got a good deal on the first try  ,5
1275,came with no visible scratches and was working well     battery health when it arrived  the only thing that i would recommend would maybe include a lightning to audio jack connector  since that would come in the original box  but overall  i would say this was a good deal on a unlocked phone ,5
1276,i bought these phones for my preteen granddaughters and they absolutely love them  although they do not live near me they tell me that they are delighted with them  the phones are exactly as advertised and work well ,5
1277,it works  but it s really finicky  can never seem to connect to the internet and constantly kicks you out of apps  needs to restart a few times a day  battery life is good  storage is great ,3
1278,phone looked great  however  battery health was promised to be greater than     it was    and the phone indicated the battery needed “service ” contacted the seller and they offered a partial refund  the partial refund was     not even enough to replace the battery  which i am going to have to do this week because it literally goes from    to dead in   minutes  not very pleased  i asked for enough to replace the battery and that wasn’t an option  i could send it back and try my chances with a new phone  but i couldn’t be several days without any phone ,2
1279,it works great for me ,4
1280,this phone works well  came as delivered cut  there seems to be something wrong with the audio for phone calls  but otherwise it’s a great phone ,4
1281,if you don t care about the price that is high than a year ago  it is the very good choose for have a iphone which can serve you for a long time ,5
1282,like new  i have had this phone for   months now with no problems at all  really happy with my renewed phone it treated me like a new phone would  saved alot of money buying used and i get to use fingerprint reader which i wish apple would bring back on newer phones ,5
1283,had an issue with battery not holding charge  seller was prompt and courteous about solving the issue  daughter loves the iphone ,4
1284,awesome packaging and have to sign in order to get the package  phone works perfectly  good deal ,5
1285,came as described and two days early ,5
1286,me llegó un iphone   como nuevo sin ningún rasguño  y con el    de la condición de su batería  si presenta algún fallo actualizare este comentario  por el momento     ningún desperfecto  está    desbloqueado para cualquier operadora de telefonía ,5
1287,needed a phone for my elderly mother  and this was perfect   overall quality and reliability are great on this refurbished model   no scratches  dings  or cracks anywhere   in addition  for this being an iphone    battery life remains quite good ,5
1288,setup was a breeze  from the moment you turn the phone on the phone practically setup itself  u answer a few questions   and all data is transferred   i took it to t mobile to switch the sim card  but that s it   easy peasy   ,5
1289,as new  working and looking great ,5
1290,got the mobile in a great condition  no scratches or dents on mobile  looks almost like new ,4
1291,this phone was for a family member   their   was on its last leg  but they didn’t require the latest technology  or the price tag that goes with it   i’m glad i took a chance on the refurb   the phone works great  it looked new when i took it out of the box  and i had no issues with swapping out the sim card from the old phone and getting it up and running  a great buy ,5
1292,i was very concerned about the hit or miss reviews from a used iphone by others but i’m glad that i decided to take the risk  the iphone arrived in timely manner in a non apple box with charger and cable  no ear bud  i have many apple chargers and ear buds etc so i did not need them  i only needed the phone and it was in great condition  glad to be able to reuse a product that still has a lot of remaining useful life ,5
1293,it is a good phone but came with    battery health and came dead so i had to charge it,4
1294,it came with what it said it would   it works fine so far had some scratches on the screen but other than that decent shape,4
1295,good  it is what you can expect from a refurbished phone  battery not at     but more or like      ,4
1296,there was a minor error with the delivery  showed it was delivered on the   of this month but came on the     assuming because of easter weekend  otherwise iphone performs like a brand new device  battery life is great   came with everything that was expected ,5
1297,i had a great experience with this purchase thus far  after reading some reviews about possible issues i was concerned and contacted seller  they responded quickly       with multiple questions i had and related information about the t mobile only iphone i had purchased and made me feel very comforable with the purchase  a  customer service was my experience and the phone is in great shape for  renewed   will update if needed  with phone and network carriers it pays to do a little homework sometimes ,5
1298,overall the quality is good,4
1299,this was a gift for my   year old mom who was struggling with her last  off brand  smartphone  she loves this iphone and finds it extremely easy to use  i hope it lasts her a long while ,5
1300,almost didn t purchase this phone  based on some reviews but so far it s working great   look brand new   got it earlier than the original delivery date  n it came unlockedwill update if anything,4
1301,i would give   stars if possible  purchased   of these phones  one the volume randomly goes up and down and the other has completely stopped charging after exactly   days of use  these were a gift for my son and niece for christmas  i wish they didn t end up getting terrible gifts because of a seller on amazon with defective items    do not buy from them at all ,1
1302,i find no issues other than battery life  fairly good for the given price,4
1303,after almost one year use  this phone works smoothly for my purposes except for its relatively short battery life  but this could be fixed if i decide to change a new battery ,5
1304,the phone was great the first three months  after three months  the battery drops from    to    in less than an hour doing simple things  it is disappointing ,1
1305,got this for my granddaughter  she loves it  the case is amazing too ,5
1306,very happy with the refurbished device ,5
1307,i was skeptical after seeing both wonderful and poor reviews of refurbished phones  we are thrilled with our purchase  it looks brand new  appears to have a good battery life  and connected to our carrier with no issues siri was difficult to set up  but everything else has been a great deal ,5
1308,i was very scared about getting this phone based on the reviews  but this phone is perfect like it’s brand new  no scratch’s  no cracks  no problem setting up with my carrier  so if your scared about purchasing one go ahead and purchase    ,5
1309,a word to the wise  have breed check the imei of what they re sending you  imei s are specific to gsm or cdma  and even if the phone is fully unlocked  if the imei doesn t match  it won t work  for example  verizon and sprint have compatible imei s  and at t and t mobile are compatible i got a phone  and the imei did not work with my network  which is how i learned about all of this a word on breed  though  they are very easy to talk to  and very helpful  i doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network  i returned my phone with no problems  and they were very understanding about the difficulty ,3
1310,i ve just had this iphone   for a few days  so far it s just like having a new phone  i had a little trouble getting all the apps and data transferred from my   but with a little bit of help from apple it went quickly  so far so good ,4
1311,it is ok but when i first got it the speaker would not work but it is ok now,4
1312,i bought two phones from this seller and one of them didn’t work  i contacted the seller and they stood behind their work and sent another phone to us after we sent the other one back  i will definitely buy from them again  they work like brand new phones ,5
1313,so far it’s a great phone  battery life isn’t the greatest but otherwise a great buy ,4
1314,the phone is what it is supposed to be  the charger on the other hand is only a    instead of a      i hope to hear from the supplier so i can charge the phone correctly update the supplier did ship the correct charger ,5
1315,i brought this phone for my son as a replacement and  the phone company can’t activate it and it’s supposed to be unlocked,2
1316,came on time  good packaging  phone is pristine looking   not a scratch on the front or back   works and sets up as you would expect of an iphone   the only downside is the battery life is      i normally change a battery at    so i will be changing this within the year   if battery life is important a new battery installed at apple is      so add that to your cost ,3
1317,phone arrived sooner than expected  looked absolutely brand new  and after i put my sim card in  it was up and running  it’s been perfect so far  it charges to     and stays charged all day  great deal for a great phone ,5
1318,got the product today set up everything   looked very new little scratch mark s on the volume side but it was very very small and unnoticeable   there was also a screen protector which is a plus   buy at your own risk some people might get a bad phone and some will get a new good phone   you can always return for a refund or replacement   i ll update if any faulty issues happen,5
1319,product was dirty  looked old  and was not usable  not in excellent condition  and also the phone was locked  description stated it was an unlocked phone  my daughter was disappointed ,1
1320,battery life is much better than represented by reviews   plenty of charge for a day unless you spend most of your time on facetime or watching netflix ,5
1321,replaced a   and works like a new phone,5
1322,mom likes it,5
1323,my company phone that was turned in at retirement was the   and the renewed one i purchased works just like my old one battery is good and cosmetics a great  would recommend for those without the need for   pricing,5
1324,the phone is great  except for the health of the battery     only   and for the fact that two of the accessories they sent me were broken on the upside  the screen and the metal casing have no scratches  they look like new i ll definitely keep it  i was afraid i might have to return it  ,1
1325,very nice phone and just about the same exact size as my iphone     i am not so sure i like the glass back and won t be charging wireless on it but i m overall very happy with this phone   i am not a big user as far as calls and texting goes but the device is very fast and looks great   as an owner of both the   and   i am not sure i would notice the difference except for the glass back   i ll try to post another review as i get more used to this phone   d,5
1326,awesome     so easy to transfer from one phone to another   i had iphone se  what a wonderful difference   this phone does not looked renewed   i would tell anyone to purchase from this seller   quick transaction and delivery ,5
1327,the iphone   is probably the best iphone apple ever made  i bought two from this seller that refurbished them  they were like brand new  and setup was very simple  my kids loved them  this is a good seller and these phones are definitely worth the money ,5
1328,the iphone i got wouldn t ring when people called me  adjusting settings and resetting the phone didn t fix it  so  i asked for an exchange rather than a refund because other than the ringing issue  i was happy with the phone  they told me the phone was on the way  so i wanted to wait until it was about to arrive to send the faulty one back because my job requires two factor authentication to log into my companies  network  i can t work without it  when the last day arrived  i mailed the phone back  but they already canceled my replacement because i didn t send the phone back right away  and they assumed i was trying to scam them  they should have told me they weren t going to send my replacement until they got the other one back  that s not what they led me to believe  i contacted them and asked when i would get my phone and they said that all they can do is wait until they get the phone to refund me  so  now i don t have my phone that i need for work and lots of other things  when i do get my refund  i m not giving my money back to these people ,1
1329,arrived in good physical condition with no visible damage or scratches  everything seems to function properly  only complaint i have is that the battery is down to    capacity  apple recommends replacing the battery at    which means the    price tag is click bait  this phone will cost me    more to keep ,3
1330,i like it very much  looks perfect  i bought  it for my son and hope it will last   yes all seams perfect including finger print reader  face recognition and battery life  it’s only been   days but so far so very good ,5
1331,looks brand new  not a scratch   works good   the keyboard doesn’t always come up once in awhile but i wonder if that has to do with possible slow wifi or cell service   but i know practically nothing about technical stuff like that   i was so afraid to spend the few hundred dollars and get a piece of crap that i’d have to send back   i’m glad i finally took the leap since my old iphone se was cracked and was starting not to respond to touch screen,5
1332,can be on a   and dye   mind later,2
1333,i ve heard mixed reviews from verizon on these refurbished phones and especially in los angeles  where verizon seems to be the only one with the least amount of dead zones  i was unwilling to switch carriers  this has worked great  no reception problems   i only had one issue with it connecting via bluetooth with my car but it worked out after i took it to the apple store  note  this did not come with a pin for the sim card so i had to use a safety pin ,5
1334,haven’t had long enough to review but so far so good  ,4
1335,phone is in great condition  i’ve owned it for   months now and still works great  battery life was at    when i first got it  which is about the same my iphone   was at when it cracked  it’s now down to    but still works fine i liked that it came with a cute case so that saved me money ,5
1336,i recommend this if you don’t wanna spend up on a phone and your on a budget very good phone,5
1337,i like it looked practically brand new no scratches on it  dis like i feel the battery life is short,4
1338,it’s been several hours and phone won’t set to,2
1339,i’m happy with the iphone   and it has more than enough features for an old man like me    gb is huge ,5
1340,i like it but maybe i didn’t realize it doesn’t have for the headphone so i will buy the adapter but so far so good i will review because i still don’t know,4
1341,we were looking for a first time phone for our   year old  the price was great and it came in perfect condition  no reason to pay full price  we have been happy with the purchase ever since and will gladly do it again for our youngest ,5
1342,bought this for my grand daughter and it has what worked great  almost like it was brand new  i took it to verizon and it was truly unlocked  no issues at all ,5
1343,it was in great condition  a few minor scratches in the chassis and screen  battery health was at    which is still good  the speakers were kind of dirty and there was some dust lint particles by the camera which could be cleaned before sending ,5
1344,great shape  battery life  hopefully it works lasts  as good as it looks ,5
1345,i have no problems with the phone it works fine it does all the things it s supposed to do only down fall is that i had to buy new sim cards but that has nothing to do with the phone it self at least i don t think,5
1346,since it was my first i phone there should have been some set up instructions included but besides that the phone works great   i ordered two and both work   one for me the other for my wife ,5
1347,the exterior of the phone is in great condition for it being refurbished  the only thing i did not like was the battery life capacity is at    i probably would not buy another one unless the battery life was better  overall good phone considering i’ve only had it for a couple of days ,3
1348,for calls,4
1349,seller   hybrid itbattery life    no cosmetic imperfections of any kindtouch screen and camera  as newall buttons  volume   power and silent  clean and responsive as new this is the best refurbished set i have ever bought hats off for the seller for maintaining mint condition inventory,5
1350,screen has much more than just “a few small cosmetic imperfections ”  but overall i am very happy with my purchase and want to express how happy i am to be back on an iphone  i was using a cheap droid in the interim    i love you amazon  we don’t say it enough    cheers ,4
1351,the phone is ok but the charger chord definitely does not work  do not recommend this seller ,5
1352,i do see the reviews and it seems people had either wonderful or terrible experiences  fortunately  i ve had a great experience  came on time  unlocked  as described  few scratches  but barely seen  works    if you do not want to take your chances  don t buy  simple as that ,5
1353,doesn’t come with the iphone jack for headphones or aux but other than that i love it ,4
1354,this is going to be an accurate  unbiased review of the phone  so hear me out the phone s that are received by each person will most definitely be different  my experience went as follows upon receiving the phone the right side of the screen was popping up a little  and if it was pushed down into the phone it would cause a blemish to appear in the middle of the phone  no biggie  i just need it to perform basic actions and not die  here s where the second issue comes in to play  upon receiving the phone the battery was already at    integrity  after the   day warranty that integrity was below    and now my phone has turned off and refuses to charge  i still have my old phone so this isn t too much of an issue  however now i m out    dollars and an iphone i realize beggars can t be choosers  but you re honestly much better off getting a refurbished phone from a store ,2
1355,i never expected it to work very well  i guess i am amazed at the function of this phone   i recommend you go for it ,5
1356,this phone came in perfect condition  i was a little scared about a refurbished iphone but considering the price it was a great buy ,4
1357,they have an amazing customer service  so fast to answer any inquiries and very cooperative and their iphones are really looking like new ,5
1358,this is amazing  i got a nearly brand new iphone for half the price  it works perfectly  as if it was absolutely new  and there was not a single scratch i hate apple products  but i needed a second phone and i didn t want   android s so i just got this and i m really happy with it  i highly recommend,5
1359,parece nuevo todo perfecto valió la pena la compra,4
1360,i was happy so far and i love it  one concern though  if you use snapchat you will have to deal with the camera shutter  the phones are ment to be sold in japan so the sound connotes be muted ,4
1361,the battery is basically trash  i didn’t active this phone until just recently altho i purchased it the end on last year it was a gift an i got it ahead of time this phone literally has to be charged every   hours ,2
1362,so far my experience buying from this seller is great  phone was in pristine condition and shipped with cable and charging dongle on the device i received there were no scratches and phone was in a  condition  after   day of use battery life seems to be comparable to a new device and all aspects of phone work perfectly i will note that i switched from iphone x to iphone   for my preference of the fingerprint reader vs the face recognition among other preferences  cheaper to fix  ,5
1363,i took this phone to my sister in mexico  the phone was in great shape  but most importantly  it works great  definitely a good buy ,5
1364,excellent condition     battery capacity  nice charger    easy to transfer from old phone to this one  for my needs an iphone   is more than sufficient at a good price ,5
1365,this phone lasted me about two years  it had its problems  he would turn off randomly or crash  sometimes the touchscreen won’t work and now that it’s too it’s last days it won’t charge and it won’t even mthis phone lasted me about two years  it had its problems  it would turn off randomly or crash  sometimes the touchscreen won’t work and now that it’s to its last days it won’t charge and it won’t even function with cellular data  garbage overall  dont buy,1
1366,good buy got exactly what was i purchased can’t see any defects and is working fine ,4
1367,battery condition says it needs to be replaced,2
1368,my daughter is absolutely in love  ,4
1369,the speaker and blue tooth did not work  had to return  the return process experience with buyspry was easy and efficient  i decided to get a refurbished iphone x ,4
1370,be ready to replace battery because some of this phones are very heavily used although they work fine,3
1371,i love this phone  no scratches whatsoever  looks brand new  no difficulties thus far  i was nervous to purchase due to the reviews but decided to take a chance and i’m glad i did ,5
1372,needed a phone with more memory   this one had it and it is working as advertised   i ve had no issues with it since it arrived  knocking on wood very hard right now       have not used face recognition or fingerprint features ,5
1373,bought this for my grandma  and everything works perfectly  it came in amazing condition  no scratches or cracks  runs very smoothly  the screen protector that came with it was also good  maximum capacity for the battery is at     which is nice  great phone for a great price ,5
1374,it was in good condition  battery life was above     it’s been   months since i bought it and works well   no scratches on screen  happy with the product,5
1375,it was for my nine year old son and he’s enjoying it ,4
1376,product was exactly how the description stated  was able to have phone activated with no issues  glad that i made the purchase  daughter loves it ,5
1377,this product is very good everything works perfectly and it charges fast and will last all day,4
1378,muy fácil de activar y salió en muy buenas condiciones  sinceramente más de lo que pensaba ,5
1379,how long it took to get into it and the apple i d stuff,4
1380,product was cosmetically great and functional  the downside was the battery life  i bought this for my son and he told me the battery dies much faster than his last iphone  i had to purchase a newer battery and install it  now it’s much better and my son is happy ,3
1381,it works well  battery at       hopefully it lasts   years  but this phone with me ,4
1382,i bought these phones for my kids for christmas  two of the three are perfectly fine  but the third one has a screen that is deeply gouged  i understand they are refurbished but come on  so now i have to spend the extra    to have the screen replaced as opposed to dealing with the hassle of trying to return it and chance it not being here on time ,3
1383,  preused phone  ive purchsed  this one is much better  fingerprint reader is a little slow and needs multiple presses  cannot connect to bluetooth,4
1384,the iphone looked okay at first after about a month i noticed the bottom two screw near the charging port we’re missing upon further investigation i concluded that the screw holes attached to the face glass we’re missing so the screws had nothing to screw into so basically i’m screwed,3
1385,this phone is fantastic  my   old really wanted an iphone and we weren t going to pay apple prices for one  it arrived in great condition and looked brand new she has had it for around a month now  so i feel more confident leaving a review  we have had no issues with it whatsoever  battery life could be better the phone came with a charging cable that didn t work and seller was very quick to send a replacement out to us   great purchase so far ,5
1386,iphone touch screen does not work at the bottom  volume button stopped working after   month  after dissembling  i found some screws are missing from the original repair ,1
1387,i was worried after reading some reviews of the seller  having problems really banged up or not really working at all but when i got it it looked brand new all features of the phone works just fine and this is the first time buying a refurbished phone over all very happy with this phone,5
1388,it’s a good phone  battery could be better but other than that good phone ,4
1389,as mentioned below i found the phone to bend easily  also it doesn’t lay flat on a surface  upper left corner raises up  also the turn on button is flush with the surface of phone so difficult to ‘turn on’  i took my new protective case off to help but that didn’t improve  i know it’s a ‘refurbished phone’ but i wonder what condition it was in ‘prior’ ,3
1390,i received my phone and it looks nice but it s dead within   minutes after being charged to   ,1
1391,phone was in mint condition despite a few scratches which were barely noticeable  the battery health was at    which wasn’t too bad  all in all  a solid buy ,5
1392,ordered christmas day to replace a  broken phone  of my beloved grand daughter  arrived earlier than expected and was activated quickly  thanks amazon   vendor ,5
1393,i was hesitant to buy this for my niece but she loves it the phone works great  we have no complaints ,4
1394,just the screen doesn’t tap fr sometimes and i only had it for   days,4
1395,unlocked does not mean easy to activate  you must buy a sim card and fight w your service provider to activate it  you better always be home to sign for this item or you will never get it  all this and it was cheaper and easier to get from the boost store ,4
1396,using this phone normally it s great with gaming also but has average battery life ,4
1397,i was very satisfied w  the condition my refurbished phone was in   probably       which means  i’d give this a     rating considering the phone was used   price was decent also ,5
1398,product is very good condition and everything updated fine  box was open and was not secured very tight but all is great  this phone saved  the day ,5
1399,i’ve had this phone for four years now and it’s just starting to quit on me  i’d say that’s a great lifespan for an older iphone  this vendor is reliable  and i’ll be purchasing from them again ,5
1400,good phone but it still had a small crack in the corner when it came ,4
1401,very good product,5
1402,the battery doesn’t stay charged all day which now i have to get a new battery  not sure if the seller can help me out with a new battery ,4
1403,this phone was for my mother  we got it for her after suffering a stroke  she loves the ease of use  facial recognition  battery life and the voice commands  this has been a blessing for her to keep in touch during her hospital stay ,5
1404,great phone after i took it to apple and had a real apple screen put on it  i found out that theses   party reconditioned phone often have a cheap non apple screen installed on them     later and it works like new  still a good price but wish that they would ksut use a real screen    this one had been returned and turned around and sent to us with same issue  our apple store had a record of it being check just   months before with same problem  i did not have time to return and wait for a different one so just had apple fix it  ,2
1405,phone works great as intended but battery health arrived at     not ideal but i can pay   bucks for a new battery,4
1406,it was in very good condition and looked great  the delivery was very fast  this was a gift to a friend and the friend was very happy but mentioned the audio was a bit feeble   everything was great   the value for money was worth it  ,5
1407,phone arrived cosmetically in great condition  started up immediately and was quick to set up  so far the battery life seems to be holding up and the phone is very fast and responsive  very please with this phone especially for the price  will update if i have issues in the near future,5
1408,                    the media could not be loaded                  not very good product  the   iphone was all scratched up  the description said  renewed   sure didn t look like it  the   iphone was a replacement to resolve the issue for the   iphone and now the    replacement  iphone screen is loose so when i push on the screen and or the home button it pushes in and pops out making a clicking popping noise  listen to the bad reviews  this is the   item i m very unhappy with  not fixed and the iphone is dirty in the ear speaker  not sure what it is  but it s brown and nasty  unsanitary  listen to the bad reviews and pay attention of how many bad reviews they have and check the dates on them to see how recent they are ,1
1409,we ordered from kiss electronics  and maybe we were one of the lucky ones but the phone was in perfect physical condition    no scratches  scuffs  or other sign of wear   brand new tempered glass screen protector applied   came with a white charger from a zte phone  it works  and a generic lightning cable   battery health is at     not great but not bad either for a used phone ,5
1410,the exterior was so clean  hard to believe they were  renewed  since glass and back were scratch free had an issue with one and contacted their support and they were so understanding  i got a replacement quickly these folks are the real deal  i d buy from them again w o any hesitation ,5
1411,the glass is a little off but really happy in general for price ,4
1412,i’ve always liked iphones  and this one is my favorite so far  it fits my pocket just right  and is easy to use  so far  the battery is performing quite well  a big improvement over my old phone ,5
1413,i really like returning to the old school look with the home button   also  i like the small size  the phone was in perfect shape   the battery does ok for being an older model and smaller phone ,5
1414,remanned phone did not work completely   but return policy and refund worked great   i bought another phone from another supplier  on ebay  which has worked perfectly ,4
1415,the phone arrived in very good condition  you would think everyone would buy renewed phones at the rate they are going for  i’ll just have to see how the battery life holds up ,4
1416,phone delivered fast   in pristine condition  set up of all functions complete in about one hour  battery life while not in use over night   went from    to     in   hours  so far i rate purchase as outstanding   if long term function goes well   this will rate a happy face  ,5
1417,i expected more for the price i paid,2
1418,great phone came in just in time,4
1419,absolutely amazing  just what i was looking for  works perfectly  no hesitation to purchase from this seller again  if you have any worries about purchasing don’t  my phone is everything and more  thanks so much  xox,5
1420,second try for an amazon refurbished iphone    different vendor  one month report all good  battery health  at t carrier service  overall function without any problem  cosmetically  perfect purchased from hybrid it via amazon   first try  different vendor  for an amazon refurb iphone resulted in a no hassle  immediate refund ,5
1421,phone looks new and was extremely easy to activate on xfinity  just swapped the sim card  that’s all and was good to go  only indication it was a used phone was the battery life indicator was at     fair enough  still keeps a charge better than my last phone ,5
1422,i just received my phone yesterday and it works good and looks good  the reviews are correct  the gold is the rose gold which is what i wanted  however  i have put in my straight talk sim card and the data does not work  it says verizon at the top and i ve had an issue before buying a verizon phone not working with my sim card  i m not sure what to do ,4
1423,had minor scratch on screen but i put a screen protector on it and it fixed it  otherwise fine,4
1424,i ordered this and was sent one that didn’t work right so i was given a shipping label to return the phone and within a timely manner i was able to receive another one and it works great  thank you electronic deals and thank you amazon  ,5
1425,phone doesn’t keep a charge and the front of it fogs up on my daughter ,1
1426,phone works perfect  bower the charger doesn’t work  we bought a new charger,5
1427,i love the phone but it was not   only   and i really wanted the phone for the storage  i could have gotten a cheaper phone by just getting the iphone   that was advertised as    i hate i didn’t get to save money since the phone is the exact phone i already had but i had already promised my little sister my old phone and didn’t want to make her wait by sending this one back for false advertising  great quality and was boxed very professionally ,3
1428,good phone but battery life is not the best ,4
1429,my daughter loves her new phone  it was fully unlocked was able to take it to a cell phone store and put a phone line on it for my daughter   she loves her phone thanks  quality was great perfect condition  ,5
1430,the things i disliked about this product were the scratches  the adhesive and the battery life  but the things i liked about the phone are the display is not damaged also the fingerprint reader works perfectly  overall i recommend this phone,4
1431,the phone arrived before i expected  it works  i do wish the charger and cord were apple brand and not just compatible  the compatible ones always fail when apple updates   sigh ,5
1432,this phone is just as easy to use as my iphone   was   the pictures i take are much clearer and better quality  the battery life is amazing  i listen to a lot of music and get on the internet during the day and with this phone i don’t have to charge it to and three times a day,5
1433,the phone is beautiful and once i get to know the bells and whistles  i will be a convert  the renewed device is just like brand new  the seller is terrific and worked with me every step of the way  i switched from an old samsung galaxy    so it s like going from a vw jetta to a bmw  nice work hybrid it and amazon ,5
1434,working great and amglad i did purchase it ,4
1435,i have had no problems with this phone,4
1436,so far so good  i’m pleased with my purchase i was nervous at first  granite i’ve only had it for a few hours  but everything is working just fine so far ,4
1437,this was a good buy  excellent price and the phone works great  no problems at all ,5
1438,i was hesitant to go with a “renewed” product  but i needed more memory capacity and really didn’t want to spend a fortune on a new phone  i received this one in like new condition  it works great  and i am very pleased ,5
1439,i needed an upgrade from my old phone  it was an iphone    and the home button didn t work  and the battery life was terrible  this phone was like new  no scratches or cracks  and it works flawlessly  came fully unlocked like advertised  and all buttons all worked perfectly ,5
1440,it works  had no issues  would recommend if looking for a refurbished phone from a trusted seller ,5
1441,phone is in excellent condition  even came with a screen protector already attached  only went to an iphone  and away from android  because of darksky being sold to apple this iphone   with   seemed like a decent buy at a reasonable cost  popped the t mobile sim card into this phone  and it worked right away came with a wall adapter and usb cable nice phone in great condition ,5
1442,phone  was like it was brand new  every facet of phone was perfect  i have had zero problems with this phone  i would definitely buy from exportek inc  again ,5
1443,no chips or scratches,5
1444,great phone no scratches or anything very nice,5
1445,i like how it was affordable and worth the price  ,4
1446,no sim tool in the package   the package is there  says sim removal tool  the little piece of paper that gets punched out of the card is even there thank you google for telling me i can use a paper clip ,1
1447,this phine was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition  worked well with current carrier  mint   it was a gift for my son and he is happy with it  only con is it doesn t have a port for earbuds  we will have to buy an adaptor or wireless ,5
1448,i had to return the phone without even opening it  nothing to do with the phone or company   but they were great about accepting the return  no complaints,5
1449,loved my phone  battery life is ok ,4
1450,i was very skeptical to buy refurbished phone  especially after reading the reviews however  at this moment i am very satisfied and hope this phone will last long enough thank you ,5
1451,this renewed phone came in perfect condition   no scratches or any signs of use   it even still had a few months of original apple warranty   though i know that is not the case most of the time   would definitely recommend amazon renewed for quality ,5
1452,bought this for my brothers birthday  he absolutely loved it  everything works perfectly and we haven’t had any issues with it  great product ,5
1453,i was definitely a bit concerned of buying it due to the reviews and this was my first time buying a phone offline but i must say this phone is perfect it came just how it looks and just how it says with a charger and screen protector already on the phone  and the battery life is amazing,5
1454,i just got mine today and the camera is very shaky witch i dislike but other than that i like it,4
1455,phone as described but doesn t stay charged long at all save your money and just buy from store phone been on charger for an hour and i only have   ,1
1456,i bought this phone for myself last year  it has held up  in pretty good condition  and works like a charm  the only downside to it is that i cannot turn my camera shutter sounds off  everyone can hear if i’m taking a video  picture  voice recording  or screenshot for safety reasons  other than that i am happy with my purchase  hope that helps ,3
1457,great product from a good company  excellent communication with them  device came way before estimated delivery date  the unit is in very good condition  with only minor scuffs  i even received a screen protector which i didn t even expect  would definitely buy from the again ,5
1458,i took a flyer and purchased this  renewed  iphone and am very happy i did   i arrived with all that was included  started up right away and even worked with my present sim card   just can t get better than that ,5
1459,i’m not sure if it’s all phones like this or just mine  but it is incredibly difficult to use  the touch screen barely recognizes my fingers  it takes a lot of effort and patience to get the control center  swipe up from home button  to work ,3
1460,i ordered a red   to replace a    i was not expecting to be surprised by reading the reviews  it showed up in   days when i opened the box it looked like a new   i ordered the red one it was in perfect condition no scratches no dings  dents or scuffs it looks brand new  set it up in no time every thing is working  flawlessly i’ve had it a few weeks and no issues yet  will repost if anything goes wrong,5
1461,great product  looks new  functions well  no complaints  i did have an issue with the phone but customer service replied quickly and exchanged for another one promptly  i would recommend this company  great product  great customer service ,5
1462,very good basic phone  fingerprint reader didn t work very long ,5
1463,the phone was in near new condition  battery life is acceptable and i received my order a day early no activation problems or carrier lock       as advertised i would recommend this seller ,5
1464,i had this iphone   for one day and the glass is chipping around the edges  this phone was not dropped  bumped  or misused by me in any way  yet the glass is chipping around the edges  how    also noteworthy  it seems the glass is not properly attached  you can run a fingernail under the entire perimeter of the glass and i have never seen this with any other iphones  inferior glass material and inferior workmanship  i will not be a buyer in the future ,1
1465,phone in great condition  a few scratches on the front side  but it is more than acceptable for a used phone  battery life lasts   days with checking texts apps a few times a day    full day with heavy use very happy with this phone   thank you ,5
1466,the top right of the phone was cracked with a screen protector on top of it,3
1467,phone seemed to work fine the first couple months    months in the volume buttons no longer work   tried headset and they don’t register as being plugged in and pods are apple product so assuming it was a problem from the beginning but didn’t try them prior to   day satisfaction guarantee   have purchased   other renewed  phones through amazon and this is the first one to give me problems ,3
1468,got the phone in july  but was not able to begin using it until august due to the carrier failing to unlock the device before sending it out to us  after numerous trips to the t mobile store  eventually we had the employees call cellcow and ask them to unlock it   which they claimed they had already done  but until we called they could not add the line to my account fast forward to october and the entire phone dies  we eventually took it in to an apple authorized repair specialist and they informed us that it seemed like the logic board just died reached out to cellcow and they refused to do anything as it was outside of the   day amazon guarantee window  waste of     or so for what is essentially now a paperweight overall i wouldn t suggest doing business with this company unless you re willing to risk devices breaking just outside of the warranty window and dealing with poorly handled device unlocking ,1
1469,i finally got this iphone after so many years with an samsung i made the decision to make a change and i didn’t regret i love it and i love the way it works,5
1470,its not worth it  the battery is was bad and the screen was not original compared to another i phone i have its lower quality ,2
1471,phone is in great working order  however  the shipping box didn’t have any foam or casing around it  in order to keep the phone from moving around  it just sat inside a plastic container completely unsecured  with that said  it was a great price and functions great ,4
1472,save everything to the cloud before setting up start to new phone  info automatically cross over but takes a while to happen,5
1473,not going to lie i was very hesitant at first about making a purchase based on the reviews but    i decided to give it a try  i purchased this and arrived on date that was specified  came completely protected in the packaging  phone is refurbished  but everything looked fine with the phone  i turned it on and it was unlocked ready to use  it came with it s charger  except earphones  i m sure my mom will love this phone for her birthday gift ,5
1474,i got what i paid for,5
1475,this was my husbands first time getting a iphone and he said he wasn’t getting calls  i contacted the seller and they agreed to exchange it for us  when my husband got home he’s a truck driver  i asked to see the phone  long story short is was on do not disturb great phone and excellent customer service    ,5
1476,phone itself is great looks new but it won’t let me connect to my carrier email or connect to download apps going to get with carrie and maybe replace with a new sims card but all in all great phone  ,4
1477,phone arrived on time  and looked completely new   was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected   after two weeks  if i was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions   initially i thought i had been hacked  but i read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty   unfortunately this happened  while i was on vacation  so i ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever i was out of the house   it also deleted all my music  which i was able to re load when i returned home    it then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once i returned home  so i was without a mobile phone for several weeks   i have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem   i intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone i want  it did look perfect  the battery life seems good  and the price is very good ,2
1478,everything ok,5
1479,was refurbished  but for    i hoped for more ,1
1480,i bought this phone for my daughter and she’s very happy with it  it was in very good condition  not a single scratch  the setup was very easy and quick  touch screen works perfectly fine  i’m actually thinking about getting another one for my son ,5
1481,the phone came in great condition but i have one small problem  i had an android from metropcs before this iphone and i tried putting the sim in this phone but it says  no sim  and wont make calls  i saw another review on here that said it works with metro pcs so i m trying to figure out the problem ,4
1482,phone was fine  the charger look used and broken   had to buy a new one ,4
1483,the fingerprint did not work  the camara didn’t either   see photo   i even got a message when i tried to take a picture of a check to deposit that the reader for the strip that reads the bank no  and check no  was compromised   will not try that again   otherwise the phone works ok ,3
1484,super easy to set up  i am not a tech savvy person and it was really easy for me  transferred my verizon chip and apple id and was set up perfectly in less than an hour ,5
1485,love the product,4
1486,bought this phone for my daughter  had the protective case screen cover etc  the screen froze and has been able to unused since  submitted a return request and it’s taking weeks to get approved  pretty disappointed and wouldn’t recommend,1
1487,long battery life and great condition   it was like new ,5
1488,great phone and great support from qd electronics   i received the cell phone a day ahead of schedule and from all appearances it looked great   i did have one issue  but it was quickly resolved by qd electronics to my satisfaction and i have rigorously tested the phone over the past   hours looking for issues but finding none   i would definitely buy the  renewed  phone again and would definitely use qd electronics ,5
1489,phone was locked when received it art only one could open it awful,1
1490,i purchased this phone beginning of feb     i have been using it for   months   it acts like a brand new phone   i haven’t had a single issue   battery life seems normal   i doubt i will ever buy new again ,5
1491,everything seems to work good  phone in great condition  no problems,5
1492,problem with phones but they were quick to rectify the problems ,4
1493,these folks are great…  i by mistake sent phone back because it would not charge correctly and didn’t take out sim card  they responded quickly and professionally thank you,5
1494,my son loves this phone   he went with this model bcs he likes the smaller phones so they fit well in his pocket   i will say that this has less memory than my sons iphone   plus but has plenty of room to store things as my son keeps getting blocked from updates due to space   battery life is great and phone looked like new ,5
1495,i bought this phone to replace an older i   plus  these phones are better than computers however i need the larger screen in order to be able to read it  i bought this one unknowingly it was a smaller screen than the   plus seller took the phone back  keep in mind packaging was in same condition as when i bought it  with no question  definitely recommend this seller ,5
1496,im always afraid that i m going to buy a unlocked phone and it won t work with my t mobile network i carry  however when i bought this phone it worked just fine and she got home but the sims in and we were good to go don t think twice get it,5
1497,this is the second phone i have replaced in our family lately and i am so happy i went with this seller again   phone looks brand new and i am thrilled   thank you  ,5
1498,my phone came perfectly fine  no scratches  works great  charger came with  so far i have had no problems  i love it,5
1499,it works perfectly       like new   i was a little skeptical about buying a refurbished iphone  but am so glad i did   i couldn t be happier ,5
1500,it came in perfect condition no scratches nothing i checked the battery percentage came at a   percent which i was shocked to see when i got it it was an easy setup it was unlocked works perfectly i m very happy with this purchased,5
1501,,3
1502,this is the first android smartphone for my technologically challenged husband   i am pleased so far as to ease at him adapting to the phone   it isn t hard or difficult for him ,5
1503,so far it has been working for a few weeks now and not to much trouble getting it set up and i’m liking it,5
1504,it works well  my son loves it,4
1505,it blinks unexpectedly from time to time and when that happens i just need to turn it off  otherwise it works great ,4
1506,battery was     internals haven’t wigged out on me just yet  day two   absolutely no issues cosmetically  need i say more   based on previous reviews  it seems amazon renewed is really a hit or miss  risk comes with worry  and you’ll be worried no matter how ya slice it  but  with a   day guarantee  i’d say shoot ya shot  might just be as surprised as i was  cheers ,5
1507,i bought this phone as an upgrade from my last phone which i also bought from the same seller  my last phone lasted me   years no issues and i’m confident this upgrade will last just as long  very good quality ,5
1508,i have enjoyed upgrading to a new phone  the iphone   really meets my needs and i love that it is the same size as the iphone    for me that meant that i did not have to get used a bigger sized phone  i do miss having an earphone jack but that does not change how much i love the phone ,5
1509,phone was in a perfect condition  renewied  besides the main issue with the battery life and reason why i returned  battery was charging slow and draining fast comunication with seller was nice and smooth  refund was fast  excellent transaction if the battery had been in good condition  i would have given them   stars ,3
1510,it came with the charger and the phone like a regular phone would when you bought one  it’s battery is really good doesn’t die so fast and phone is perfectly fine would recommend ,5
1511,funciona muy bien en honduras ,5
1512,product arrived earlier than expected and works great  there is a small chip in the upper right hand corner that wasn t mentioned in the description  but not a huge issue  the package was dirty when it arrived  not sure why   ,4
1513,really bad don’t trust this product it might kill some one the batterie on it almost exploded,1
1514,phone was in great condition with the battery life as expected  shipment was very quick   great experience overall ,4
1515,i purchased this phone because my phone battery was dying  this one also has a dying battery  ,2
1516,i returned it  the phone worked ok but had issues due to no battery life  the battery lasted maybe   hours  even if you didn t use it  the battery would drain  this iphone was for my   year old mom  so she s not doing much  basic usage  she had to carry a charger and power bank until i got her a new phone the charger it came with was broken too dealing with support was a hassle  i had to contact amazon to contact them because i wasn t getting my questions answered  they just sent the same automated message to me a few times  i was finally able to get a refund though and fought them on the restocking fee since they sent me a broken device maybe i got unlucky  but i m not doing this again ,1
1517,came on time  small scratches     battery life  no problems whatsoever ,5
1518,camera does not work  we tried to reset to factory settings to get the camera to work then the phone was not recognizing passcode  we had to end up restoring and camera still does not work   everything else works ,3
1519,brought this phone for my son and he loved it  it was red with no scratches pretty much like new  the phone had better updates vs his older iphone he was able to do a lot more on his iphone  ,5
1520,it’s in perfect shape just as i expected it  it works with my carrier and i didn’t have to worry about it being unlocked  i’m extremely happy with it ,5
1521,i phone   is in good condition and works as it should  only came with the phone itself and charge cord  no plug for cord was included  shipping took longer than expected  was to be delivered     and arrived december       minimal directions on activating the phone ,4
1522,personal use…not a techie just needed an affordable phone replacement ,5
1523,it was a gift and they loved it,4
1524,iphone is everything it claimed to   it looks brand new  no scratches  cracks  or any kind of blemish   was able to connect with carrier in about   minutes  battery charges to      thumbs up for this purchase  ,5
1525,this is a very good reconditioned phone my phone didn’t even have a scratch on it the battery life was like new the amount of storage is good the only drawback is the iphone   only has a     screen if you want a larger screen you need to order a iphone   plus i highly recommend this phone,5
1526,we bought this for my daughters birthday in march but we had purchased two other phones for our grandkids as christmas gifts and they both were like brand new phones  no noticeable blemishes and everything worked just fine   they love them ,5
1527,excellent phone   the only scratches are the ones i put on the back    oops  came with no scratches and    battery health  i recommend buying this before spending hundreds on a brand new one,5
1528,i have an iphone    bought from same seller  my husband had the same model  he lost his  the new one will not stay paired  i think the phone is defective since others did  i watched videos  called apple  and still no luck  my poor old     husband is a delivery driver and has to re pair after every restart of the car  tried to find a place to contact the seller and couldn t  if seller reads this  i m in portland  or    gold iphone    please do  i don t want to have to return it ,1
1529,i like this iphone   because it s fast  that s it ,4
1530,i knew the battery could be as low as    as per warning but hoped for the best  i was pretty confident i could send back if there was an issue  dead pixels  noticeable scratches  malfunctions or tired batter  but instead i got it a little faster than expected and in great condition  i cleaned it off of course but it looked pretty darn clean anyway  bonus   pretty happy ,5
1531,phone was in excellent condition  battery health at     no scratches or dents  unlocked as described  transferring the sim card from my old phone to this one was fast and convenient with the provided tool ,5
1532,phone battery only lasts   minutes after being fully charged ,3
1533,phone works perfectly  looked practically new ,4
1534,my phone arrived before expected   it works great  it already had a screen protector   i ve had it a couple of weeks and i haven t had any problems with it at all   definitely happy with my purchase ,5
1535,great product,5
1536,it was in perfect condition and no problems thus far  i read the negative comments  but we have no complaints and would by from them again  we are pleased ,5
1537,so far so good  worth the money,4
1538,phone was physically in good shape  unfortunately we had to return this phone because the battery was bad and could not hold a charge for  ore than a few hours even when not in use  seller approved return quickly  however we are still waiting for refund to come through ,3
1539,got this phone for my wife to take a chance and it s working so great  decided to buy another phone for myself  i would definitely but from this buyer if you are looking for a great phone  super fast shipping as well,5
1540,i was in desperate need of a new phone and this is perfect  no negative comments about this phone ,5
1541,this phone came in very good condition and even had a screen protector already on it  it’s working well  and i would definitely get another phone like this ,5
1542,item just as described      works great,5
1543,thinking you’re getting a good deal  you’re not  i don’t get paid for these ads either  first off the battery life had a black screen with a urgent message stating that the battery would soon have to be replaced  there were minimum scratches on the phone which was nice but agajn  not paying    for a phone that needs a new battery  look elsewhere,1
1544,nice phone  works well  what i expected  would order from seller again  ,4
1545,we have had it for baout a month and a half now  it occassionally is a little slow glitchy but other then that its nice  it only reads our finger prints a quarter of the time  at points the phone stops working and it gets frustrating ,4
1546,when i ordered this phone i had all kinds of apprehension over it being what they promised  i have never spent that amount on money on a phone and it scared me  this phone is in perfect condition without any blemishes at all    the phone charges quickly and holds a charge really well  i love my new phone ,5
1547,it came with some visible marks on the back side of the phone and the charger that came along looks cheap  black plug and white cable  looks a bit funny to the sight  i am hoping that it wont cause any issues in long run ,3
1548,the iphone it s in perfect condition i make a test series and it s like a new iphone   baterry life    renewed premium it s the bests phones in amazon i am very satisfied with this phone ,5
1549,publicidad engañosa compre este iphone en estado bueno y la bateria tenia menos del    como lo ofrecen en su reseña  ,1
1550,as soon as i turned it on  it transferred everything and set itself up    i love it,5
1551,product came early and no dents or scratches  we had no problems switching from sprint to these t mobile phones  my mom and daughter are very happy ,5
1552,i been having this phone for a couple of months now  i bought it right before going away for training  the speaker  is broken  i sent an email to the sender hoping to get a replacement before leaving  unfortunately they refused until they received the defective item back  that was impossible for me  since i didn’t have a replacement  they always want their money upfront  regardless of how they send their items out  which is not fair  ,3
1553,phone works fine… ,5
1554,my daughters love their new phone and i am very pleased with what i purchased and how legit it really is and can be used at any  carrier thank you for the great product and easy purchase ,5
1555,i brought total three this   to do iphone   family plan trade in promotion  all three phone are looks new and also very good quality  the trade in process is very smooth and has no problem  highly recommended ,5
1556,amazing phone for price,5
1557,item as promised,5
1558,received as described  one scratch but in great condition,4
1559,this was a gift to my   year grandson   he said  best gift ever ,4
1560,the phone itself works fine with no issues except that the keyboard freaks out randomly when trying to type anything  makes for a very frustrating time texting and searching internet  having to backspace several times t get out what you are trying to type ,3
1561,battery only lasts a few hours  granted  it is constant use  but wa hoping for a few more hours ,3
1562,please check these phones before reselling them  sometimes they are a christmas present and that can be very disappointing  it s stated that these phones are refurbished  but work  this phones speakers are broke and you can t hear anything  they were encrusted with dirt and grime  and the battery dies in no time at all  deleting my comment won t make it go away  i want a replacement  a good replacement,1
1563,my camera wasn t working but overall the phone is great,4
1564,i was worried about buying a refurbished phone but i m so glad i did  i have been using it for two days now  the battery  lasts the day and charges with no problem at night  all the functions are in working order and the phone looks brand new  i love this phone and i love that i didn t have to sign a contract or pay an insane amount for a new phone ,5
1565,if you want a cheap way to get a really good condition device then this not a terrible way to go   the device works well and seems to be in great condition but i would not trust the tagline of  product works and looks like new  the product was delivered loose in a box with almost no accessories other than a charger   it was just in a baggy  not even secure and has several small scratches on the screen i am still happy with the purchase but i don t like to be lied into thinking i was getting what should have been a  like new  product ,3
1566,this phone works great and came on time  there is one small crack on the side of the screen but i hardly notice it and the product description explained there could be small imperfections  great product for the price i paid ,5
1567,i find it kind of inferior in certain features  i tried to return it but i cannot be without a phone and i have no way to print the label anyway   our little mountain town doesn’t have a way to print things as those businesses are closed due to covid  so  i’m “making do” with this one ,3
1568,purchased this device as a replacement for my dad  i was a bit skeptical at first since i am always leery about purchasing used iphones on line  but i was not disappointed with this one   arrived well packaged and without a scratch or mark  good experience with this one ,5
1569,phone came in like brand new condition  looks and works amazing and didn’t have to pay the amount most have to in a store   i will be back when it’s time to upgrade again,5
1570,it’s a great phone but like most apple products the battery isn’t the best but it works great other then the battery ,4
1571,i ve been using this phone for   weeks  and i ve never had an issue  the battery life is good  and overall it s as if it hasn t been used before ,5
1572,el teléfono llegó perfecto a chile  me lo trajo una amiga demoro en llegar por eso  no me costo nada habilitarlo  el pequeño y único detalle que la cámara venía como saltada la pintura pero todo funciona perfecto,5
1573,had to switch from sprint to t mobile to get the device unlocked  the device itself is great  it’s the first apple iphone with wireless charging  good looking device  no scratches or dents,5
1574,looked like brand new   manual not in box but since it is a refurbished  i didn t expect it and it s easy enough to download on the net   works like brand new   the only thing i didn t realize was apple changed the shade of gold   not too happy with apple but very happy with the product over all   a nice black case solved the new apple gold problem   the best thing   the price ,5
1575,the phone looks and feels like it’s new  the phone has a   battery heath when it arrived and touch screen worked fine until i put a protective cover and it acts ups doe time i don’t know if it is the phone or it’s the  extra glass  touch id works better than it did on my iphone se  i also like the water proof it has ,5
1576,love this iphone   easy for my daughter to use  lots of storage   my daughter is special needs and doesn’t use the face recognition nor the fingerprint reader  sorry if that’s not helpful   very satisfied customer cjdavis,5
1577,great product  switching from an android  had to get used to  battery comes as an     so i purchased a new high capacity battery from this website  costs about        installed it  and waiting to put the first charge to it ,5
1578,i love my new to me iphone    i’ve always had androids  not anymore  the phone looked good and felt like brand new  it arrived with a six foot long heavy duty charging cord that i find convenient for those times i need to use my phone while it’s charging  i’d buy this phone from this seller again without hesitation,5
1579,amazing product     value for moneythe fingerprint reader is the best i have seen so far  the face recognition is spot on and battery life last    i get to charge in the evening after work,5
1580,communication,4
1581,the delivery was prompt as estimated  and the phone overall is good ,4
1582,i have no complaints   set the phone up and it works just fine ,4
1583,great product  high quality  and practically new ,5
1584,this was my first iphone purchase  i was a little worried about purchasing a used one  however  the phone is a gem  in excellent condition  good battery  takes great pictures  i like it so much i m purchasing another used iphone for my granddaughter   i should have done this a long time ago ,5
1585,the phone works amazing  the battery life only came at    which i am kind of bummed about  but the thing that really bugs me is the back camera won’t focus  i looked it up and tried all the methods of fixing it  updating did nothing and can’t get it to focus ,3
1586,this was shipped very quickly   the phone performs well   it was the replacement for the fatally damaged iphone   which my son had become very fond of   glad i made this replacement purchase   price was right ,5
1587,the phone kind is sucks it turns off in the middle of talking or just doing something on the phone and it does a few times in a row before i can actually start doing something on my phone again,5
1588,great battery life fingerprint and face recognition as well also plenty of storage and great for the price i love this phone i highly recommend it,5
1589,i received my iphone   in gold and i highly recommended it battery capacity was   percent i called apple and got diagnostic testing done and everything works   percent iphone is unlocked  very happy with my purchase,5
1590,i had never bought a phone online because i can never trust if it’s a good phone or not  but the phone i got was great  it was an iphone    everything worked great  highly recommended ,5
1591,the gold phone is actually rose gold   but that s what i was looking for  there were a couple of small scratches on the screen and some wear on the back glass panel  but it works great and everything is fully functional  it also charges really quickly and has a great camera ,5
1592,phone works great and battery life is great ,5
1593,everything has worked as claimed  no problem at all,5
1594,iphone is in even better condition than i expected  excellent product and shipping ,5
1595,rear camera glitches due to autofocus,4
1596,wow  i was pretty skeptical and nervous about buying this from the reviews  the box seemed a bit damaged like someone had tried to open it but nonetheless  i opened the box  set up the phone  and it works perfectly  i love this phone  do not hesitate to buy  it is unlocked  no scratches or damage at all  i did not expect this phone to be in such great condition  knowing that it was used  you won’t regret it ,5
1597,great development,5
1598,had no trouble at all in the setup and phone came with    battery health and no scratches or cosmetic damages  some reviews say their phone was gsm only and did not work with their carrier  be sure you check which phone you are getting because some did not say fully unlocked  i ordered the silver and all i did was switch my sim card over and everything was there  didn t even have to contact my carrier,5
1599,it came in better condition than my old iphone   which was bought on the apple website  there’s no scratches or issues with the phone itself  it’s exactly as advertised  perfect ,5
1600,no syms card,3
1601,great deal so far  however had problems with the shipping   i e  fed ex,4
1602,                    the media could not be loaded                  i was terribly shocked when i received the item   the phone was very small  very old  had huge visible scratches all over and shows no sign of being refurbished   i’ve purchased refurbished phones from amazon before and they look almost new on the exterior   this must have been the worst purchase i’ve ever made   i’ve requested a refund and will be returning this item,1
1603,great phone   i ve had it for several weeks now and it s worked very well  like new   the battery life is good  as well as the picture quality   it was super easy to set up and transfer all the data from my old phone   very pleased ,5
1604,this was a gift and an upgrade from an iphone    i don’t want to talk about the iphone tech— go to a apple for that  i want to talk about the fact that it’s a refurbished iphone for a ridiculous price that had me worried because it seemed toooo cheap  well  it worked out without any issues  i can vouch for it being unlocked because it’s currently being used in tokyo on a non american carrier ,5
1605,the packaging was very good when it had came  no scratches or anything of that sort and very nice to use  battery life is absolutely phenomenal and i would definitely recommend this to other people  i am very happy with this product ,5
1606,i needed to upgrade from my iphone   lol  i refuse to buy the latest iphone for work purposes so this phone came in handy,5
1607,our daughter was easily able to transfer her number and all info by swapping her chip to the new phone  this new phone started communicating with her old phone as soon as she started setup  was pretty darn cool to watch  thought it would be a long half day ordeal changing everything over and phone number etc  nope  she was up and running in know time  whew ,5
1608,recibimos el celular de acuerdo a lo ordenado  funciona perfectamente y llegó en el tiempo previsto  muy conforme con esta compra ,5
1609,i like almost everything about this phone  the problems are the back camera is worse than an iphone   maybe even as bad as the   or even worse than that and to add on to that  the back of my phone doesn’t even have an apple logo   i am not happy with this purchase do not recommend ,5
1610,great phone for your money hands down  but kinda regret it bc it was a gift for a girl i was talking to and now she is with someone else  at a least i know the block button still works on the phone,5
1611,i had to return this producer because the screen came scratched,4
1612,i was most disappointed   they left an iphone on my front porch   my husband was home   no phone or ring   it was little enough to go in our locked mail box   or require a signature  or ring the bell   something    it was inboxed   no apple charging cord or plug   the screen ha many little scratches and is cloudy   won’t but from this complaint again   the reviews were good so i felt confident with my purchase ,3
1613,amazing price for a newly refurbished   storage red iphone    i am exceedingly pleased with the purchase of this unlocked iphone    it has worked flawlessly  and is in perfect condition  i loved the packaging and you all even included the pin to open it’s sd card with  thank you ,5
1614,needed new battery unfortunately,5
1615,entrega en tiempo y forma  producto en buenas condiciones salgo que a veces se tilda la cámara de fotos  este modelo no cuenta con reconocimiento facial ,3
1616,purchased for my wife  she loves it  battery life is excellent  device looks like new  not a scratch  this is our first apple product  operation is different from android phones  but it seems easier for her to operate  overall a great device  worth the price ,5
1617,within   hrs the phone malfunctioned and would not allow me to enter my code to access the phone  the screen was showing glitches  delays  and making noises   i attempted to do a reset shut down and that did not work  i sent the phone back indicating the phone is defective  the seller informed me that i would be charged a restocking fee because the phone came back locked  when attempting to explain to the seller that i couldn t reset it because the phone would not allow me access it they replied with     we apologize for the inconvenience but we also found there to be no issue with the device there for the return reason was also invalid   ok  you want to charge me the restocking fee  ok  but it is extremely unsettling that the seller is telling me the phone was not broken  good luck to the next person who purchases the phone ,1
1618,my first iphone so far  i ve been wanting to buy these for a long time to see what all the rage is about iphones and i like it alot so far  really clean practically brand new no scratches or dents at all and i love the color and vibrant white,5
1619,i ordered this phone as a replacement   the description stated the battery life would be    or better   my biggest concern was the battery life  as i know from experience that once a battery gets below     it doesn t hold a charge   this phone arrived with    battery life  i won t order a replacement unless i know exactly what the battery life is  the rest of the phone appeared to be in excellent condition ,1
1620,it didn’t come with a real iphone charger   the cord was super short  the block i never saw before   the phone was in good condition tho,5
1621,upon opening it there were no damages to the device  it was perfect  came with everything i needed  but the camera was down right awful  there’s a glitch inside the camera where it doesn’t take pictures properly  iphones would usually take amazing pictures but this phone is no bueno  everything else is rather decent  it still connected to my airpods and all of that  but i will be replacing this phone soon  i definitely have to have a decent camera on my phone while traveling happy shopping ,3
1622,i made the mistake of buying a refurbished option of this phone on september       my device was sent by electonicity usa  after using it for a few months i can say that i don’t believe this phone was refurbished properly  or with apple certified parts  the battery life is very poor  it experienced an unexpected shutdown in the very first week of use the screen seems to have been replaced with a cheaper option as well  very easily scratched in comparison to my iphone    it hasn’t suffered any falls yet is covered in tiny scuffs and scratches after only few months  some of them i’m pretty sure came from my clothes  my   suffered some scratches at the hands of my keys but never from my favorite christmas sweater the charger included was also very cheap and didn’t even work for my device  it did however work okay for my   ,1
1623,the phone was in very nice shape and the shipping was very prompt   the    credit for the iphone   i sent back made the entire process seamless   this will be my benchmark for the next time i upgrade ,5
1624,i love my new iphone  it’s refurbished but it’s new to me   i set it up myself  really easy  it said no sim  asked my do i need to put it in new phone  he told me to google it   i was smart enough to fight out  when i called number and old phone rang  i figured it out ,5
1625,this is an amazing phone,5
1626,it was as described   and works like it should ,5
1627,physically the phone functions and looks great  the only drawback is that the phone is likely from japan or another country that has laws requiring camera shutter sounds to always be on so i can’t take selfies because everyone around me will hear it  and the sound isn’t quiet ,4
1628,very pleased  unless we knew it was a refurb  i would not have guessed  cosmetically excellent  great battery life  clean  no issues at all basically the new iphone experience for    less ,5
1629,i’ve had this phone for about a month and so far it has worked perfectly fine  when i got it  i right away checked it’s imei to be sure it wasn’t blacklisted or something  i didn’t want to put my info or sim card right away  but imei is clean  so it’s all good  it wasn’t damaged at all  it looks new  battery lasts a long time  it was a good deal if i say so ,5
1630,what a great deal on the latest iphone prior to the    breakthrough  refurbished and haven t found an issue  a great deal upgrading from my iphone    apple is making the phones tougher  so you can t even tell it s used   btw  everyone s goods are  used  after they open the box ,5
1631,terrible battery life  charges fast  people only hear me via bluetooth and speaker,4
1632,it was in pristine condition  battery health was in    but works excellent  i’ll replace battery after  now i’m very satisfied  ,5
1633,the phone works perfectly,5
1634,overall a solid buy  some minor volume and brightness issues but overall a good value ,4
1635,at first it seemed sketchy  i was just looking for a new phone after owning an iphone   for   years  i bought it and it came a day in early  first seeing it it was in good condition  the only thing that i didn’t like was it had these tiny scuffs but you could barley see it  also the battery health was    wanted something over     overall my phone has been just fine ,5
1636,yeah iphone was as described which is good  i wanted to write a quick review because the charger brick did not work when we got it  i reached out to the seller and they apologized and immediately shipped out a new brick  great service ,5
1637,lector de huellas funciona correctamente    no tiene reconocimiento facial y la vida útil de la batería esta por debajo de lo garantizado por amazon  mayor al    también quiero aclarar que solo traía el accesorio cable de datos  sin cargador ni aguja de extracción de sim  decepcionante al momento de cumplir con lo ofrecido ,3
1638,arrived quickly in perfect condition ,5
1639,charging cord that it came with didn t work after a week and still have problems charging with the right cords sometimes,4
1640,i just received my i phone   gold   really good product i will keep you updated,4
1641,phone works as expected  no problem adding it to my verizon contract line  and it was in like new condition ,4
1642,this was  by leaps and bounds  the best quality refurbished phone i have ever purchased  unfortunately  due to an error on my part  i will be needing to return it  i would highly recommend this seller ,5
1643,i was a little skeptical of buying this after reading some of the reviews  but i’ve had this phone for about   months now and haven’t had a single issue  i love it  and was well worth the price  everything worked well  the phone itself was in good physical condition  no scratches  i’d buy again ,5
1644,super contenta con la compra  el teléfono llego rápido  lo traje a panamáestado físico  impecable  ningún rasguño bateria      lo que promete entrega  rápido  vino super protegido  estoy super feliz hasta el momento todo bien,5
1645,this phone is in mint condition  i must say i’m impressed  however  we’re told that we’re guaranteed a minimum of    battery health but this came with     disappointed  would’ve liked if it came with a lot more than that ,3
1646,it was in like new condition  extremely happy with my purchase and would buy again,5
1647,its honestly a great phone  and it works well  everything about it is fine  it still has    battery capacity  the cameras are great  its very fast  the only problem is that when i got it the phone was still locked onto another carrier  my carrier is metro pcs and they told me that i would have to talk to the seller and get them to actually unlock the phone because it s still locked onto another account  this is very frustrating  hopefully i can return the phone and actually get it unlocked soon ,3
1648,very clean phone and in great condition ,5
1649,i can’t take screen shots  not sure why it doesn’t work so i have to ask siri every time other than that it works great,5
1650,when the package arrived i was disappointed because it was not wrapped well but when i opened it up the phone was looking pretty good i was impressed  my previous iphone   battery health was at    but this   arrived at    i was very surprised by this  everything seems to be working well with the phone so far so i am very satisfied ,5
1651,i purchased this phone for my son  he loves it  i’m glad i was able to find it  i thought it was a good price too  this phone doesn’t have facial recognition  but that’s ok ,5
1652,this phone is in excellent condition   it coulld be a brand new iphone   once i charged the battery set up only took minutes since i had backed up my iphone   and just needed to restore that backup to this new iphone     i have been using it since then and can t find any defects   very pleased with my purchase ,5
1653,the unit was in good condition with a very small crack on the corner which does not affect the screen or performance  it came with a charger and lightning cable  very satisfied for the price ,5
1654,i m quite easily impressed with the advances in technology   this is all i need    little touchy with big fingers     a sexy little beast  battery gooood    that s important  touche         wow ,5
1655,bueno y en buen estado,4
1656,this has been an awesome refurbished phone  there was absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever   sprint hooked it up with no issues and i had officially made the switch from galaxy to iphone and i am never looking back ,5
1657,this was exactly as i had hoped  the phone arrived in perfect condition  the battery is not new  but it does make it thru the day without dying  works as promised with no issues ,5
1658,the phone looked great   things seem to be working fine except for the phone holding a charge   the battery doesn t seem to hold a charge for very long at all  resulting in having to recharge the battery several times a day   i looked at my invoice to see how long i have to return it   when i ordered the phone  i paid for the extra warranty  however  that does not show up on my invoice   i have not contacted the seller yet  but plan to do that now ,2
1659,though the battery life was lower than expected  for the price this phone has been great  no other issues  no scratches  cracks  or dings  works with verizon  i had my doubts that it was compatible and previous comments were inconsistent  ,4
1660,very good product  the price was also fair  all features functional ,5
1661,great product,5
1662,works good,4
1663,the back camera doesn’t work  there was scratches all over the back  and the speakerphone won’t work most of the time  i get that it was refurbished but i just bought one a year ago and it looked brand new ,3
1664,good first phone for my kid,4
1665,very impressed with my iphone   i ordered  easy to set up just had to insert sim and it was ready  looks brand new   has one pin size chip by charging port but really have to look close to see it  this is only day one so i hope nothing goes wrong   i will never order a new phone again if this one holds up ,5
1666,the phone is in amazing shape and appears brand new  was refurbished but honestly couldn’t tell  was exactly what it described in the listing and for a good price  highly recommend this seller for refurbished iphone,5
1667,i can confirm that at first i was skeptical about buying a phone from amazon but i got it with minimal scratches and a great battery life of     everything was as advertised,5
1668,needed a new charger bcuz it didnt belong to phone but seller sent me one asap   did have a while on the phone with tmobile to clean phone to factory reset  then it work great looks brand new  no scratches  slick looking red phone  yes pick the red   lol  definitely a great deal  thank you seller,5
1669,i bought my refurbished iphone   towards the end of february of   i recently started having problems with the camera hardware  i ran a diagnostics test over the phone with apple support  what happened is not my fault at all now i have no working camera and am look at roughly    to have it fixed at an apple store ugh ,3
1670,phone was in great condition,5
1671,i received mine iphone on january    it started really good i enjoy it  but now it s not charging  i hoping it s the charger if not i need to send the phone back and get a refund or another one ,5
1672,all security features are very good,4
1673,i purchased this renewed iphone    in december   for my wife to replace a very old previous one  it’s operation has been far less than consistent owing to increasing occurrence of dropped calls  inability to reach attempted calls  and generally declining performance  i purchased this phone on the basis of having a great experience with buying a renewed iphone   plus from amazon anyway  we’ve had this phone since december   knowing it is technically past a warranty return  but nevertheless  given my very long and strong status as an amazon customer  i’m hopeful some form of remedy may be possible for this failing phone ,2
1674,sold under amazon renewed by olympus the screen was defective   amazon would do nothing to help and olympus only offered to refund the product at my shipping expense   so there is no amazon renewed guarantee other than you can get a refund   spend hours with customer service with no resolution update   the seller now has offered to pay return shipping after brining it to their attention therefore i have improved the rating ,3
1675,i did another restore to factory and its fine now i d say  buy from a person who has good reviews and you should be fine ,4
1676,the device was in near perfect condition  it had a few scratches on the rear glass  but nothing noticeable from afar  the battery health was at    it even came with a screen protector  would buy again ,4
1677,it stopped working at   last night   no warning  black screen   would not take a charge from wall outlet lasting until   today   no response   insurance was a monthly fee autodeducted so i would be allowed to make a claim   over    is the fee to make a claim   i canceled the insurance subscription  the phone was bought as a  premium renewed  item ,1
1678,it was in better condition than i expected  i ve heard stories about refurbished phones on amazon being all scratched up and dirty  this one at least was in great shape ,5
1679,the iphone was all that i expected  i was comfortable with a refurbished phone because i knew amazon would stand behind it and would have no reason to sell anyone a defective or misrepresented product  i m pleased ,5
1680,phone died after   months exactly  went to an apple store as well as to an independent lab  both said battery change won t help and nothing can be done  the seller   cellcow   was very polite but unhelpful  this is their response   all of our devices go through a   point inspection    things like this will happen on occasion  we have to follow the policies and procedures under the amazon renewed program in order to be able to sell on this platform  amazon will not even allow you to send the device back because it is out of warranty and we have no control over this nor can we circumvent the system  so either the seller did not renew the phone properly  or it s amazon s fault and their  amazon renewed  program is bad  either way   stay away ,1
1681,worked well for about two weeks when the ear speaker began failing  daughter used a bluetooth and speakerphone until i asked about it     days had to search n search for the   day warranty  seller wasted time   i have a refund posted and a refusal to accept the return  rest of phone is failing  pulling all methods of payment and will dispute any future charges  like amazon refurb  need a central single‘seller’,3
1682,don’t be discouraged if it comes in a verizon box  i was and i have metro pcs  phone is unlocked and ready to use when you get it  barely any wear on the phone and i only noticed a tiny scratch around my camera  that is is  the graphics are amazing  the sound quality is impeccable  definitely recommend this phone  only downside is no aux port  but still has the button unlike the iphone x series ,5
1683,i purchased this phone from buyspry   the phone works great  except you cannot turn off the sound of the camera shutter   it is a japanese model   in japan  there is a law that phones must make a sound when taking a photo   the sound does not play when taking a live photo  but in any app that uses the camera  it will make a sound when taking a still photo even if it is muted   quite annoying if you are trying to take a photo of something in a quiet room ,3
1684,i had ordered   iphone  ’s  all were in perfect conditions  came with certificates of complete diagnostics to make sure every single component is functioning as it should  came with brand new chargers  screen protectors and cases for them all  never been more satisfied with a purchase ,5
1685,the phone was fine at first and a week or so later there were issues with the sound   i think this can happen when you get a refurbished phone   we returned it with no issues ,3
1686,still works till this day  no issues at all  reliable seller  everything matched the description  highly recommended,5
1687,great looking almost perfect finish with battery health at     use it as a ipod for walking around property as is lighter than my actual phone,5
1688,great price and it s better than han the   plus ,4
1689,my son is happy with this phone ,4
1690,i cannot say enough positive things about this company or product  it came looking a brand new phone and with everything they promised  only thing maybe they could toss in a set of headphones with the order but that’s a very minor thing  other than that it is worth ordering from this company  i will definitely be back for more products ,5
1691,i like that it is the same size as the   so i could keep the same case  i also got it with more space for business purposes,5
1692,i was very pleased with the phone very easy setup service plan to come very easily at this time i have no complaints whatsoever highly recommended buying from amazon prime about   from straight talk and neither one of them would activate or work,5
1693,i was purchasing this as an upgrade from a different brand  i was skeptical of the seller  as many reviews detailed frustrating situations with device quality issues  one month in and i have had no complaints  device performs as expected ,4
1694,the phones actually came   days sooner than they were supposed to be delivered and both were in perfect condition  the fingerprint scanner worked  battery has a full charge  and face recognition worked just fine  well worth the money we spent  ,5
1695,item came in perfect condition  almost like new    across the board  will purchase again soon ,4
1696,just as advertised nothing wrong with the phone at all  great condition no scratches  great camera  and plenty of memory  i did hook it up through straight talk only thing was finding a sim that was compatible with the phone was a little difficult but that can be fixed through the straight talk website  does not come with headphones but does come with charger and a screen protector already on the phone ,5
1697,bought an iphone   unlocked for t mobile and i put in my sim card and it started working immediately  i’ve never had an iphone so transferring my files was annoying and my apps didn’t transfer but w ethe phone works  there was some damage on the bottom but i knew there would be ,5
1698,husband lost his phone  and this was a fast replacement  we received it quickly  and it works great ,5
1699,i tried to install my sim card wouldn t work not sure if its a carrier problem the screen was scratched pretty noticeably not packaged to well phone was rattling around the box probably why it was so scratched from the screen,3
1700,small hair line scratches on screen but    for an   is a good deal  i’m very hard on my phones so great alternative to buying a brand new phone through provider  guaranteed warranty through amazon as well with purchase,5
1701,works great    battery lasts longer than my current iphone    and wayyyy longer than the old   this was meant to replace  looks and works like new      would buy again ,5
1702,this phone would be fine but the battery health is significantly degraded  i realize this is a refurbished phone  but it shouldn t come with a poor battery ,3
1703,the product was as good as new without any scratches or marks  the phone data was clean and i was able to login to the carrier using my sim card  prompt delivery was made with proper boxes and product numbers ,5
1704,i bought this phone and an extended warranty     months after i got it  the thing completely quits   took it into an apple repair shop and they said it had been refurbished with a cheap battery and that caused a major failure in the phone   reached out to vendor to which they replied  so sorry  can t help you   now it s junk   forget it  buy from reputable dealers or apple,1
1705,so far so good no issues at all battery is good finger print is good cameras are good no glitching or freezing   it’s charges good but i will update in a month or so,5
1706,doesn t keep a good charge,4
1707,i bought this as a birthday gift and could not be happier  looks and works great  had only a few minor scratches on it and those were covered with a case and screen protector ,5
1708,worked perfectly for a week  then one day it was on    battery and just died  never turned back on or charged again ,2
1709,just started using iphone for my mom so she could use it with her hearing aids  have not had any trouble with it so far ,5
1710,thanks so much  this phone is working properly ,5
1711,thus far  the phone is working out well for me  i am a first time i phone user and i was a little skeptical at first about purchasing a renewed device  however  it looked good and works just fine ,4
1712,fingerprints,4
1713,i like to use the six digit passcode for opening the phone  i do not like the face id or the finger print reader ,5
1714,it s a good for a refurbished phone  battery capacity is    which is expected  a few tiny scratches  screen is fine  will give an updated phone after a month of use ,4
1715,so far no issues  thanks so much for a quality product,4
1716,the iphone works like a charm and you can still use it for upgrades like os  ,5
1717,it s a refurbished iphone     not much to say other than this last one had a speaker that runs about     normal volume   i did ensure all sound limiting features were disabled and turned volume to max  but any time the phone receives or initiates a call it s very difficult to hear   seems like a defect that was not caught in the refurb process ,2
1718,coming from and android moto   plus  the slightly higher level of intuitiveness  the integration into a peripheral ecosystem  and the ability to more easily videochat by far outweigh the lower battery life  i can still get through a day on one charge and the difference between   and     days on a charge is meaningless if i have to charge either phone daily because one wouldn t last a full   days ,5
1719,perfect atleast to me it’s an iphone   so it’s not the newest but still newer then my last phone i will definitely buy from them again when it’s time for a new phone or upgrade ,5
1720,not sure what to review   came in  swapped sims card  did the transfer   it works  it charges   onto life now ,5
1721,phone is overall in a good condition and battery health and rest things are working well but while calling other person could not hear my voice properly i guess the microphone is not in good condition,3
1722,the phone most likely was originally sold in another country  some functions follow privacy regulations set in other countries but not in the us  aside from this being a little annoying the phone works great ,4
1723,so  far my iphone   has been great  i order it from hybrid it and they sent it in   days  the phone came with no scratches or dents  i recommend buying from them,5
1724,                    the media could not be loaded                  worked great at first my son absolutely loves it iphone   he has done so well with it he has never even so much as dropped it and when he make sure it s all in his protective gear all the time and it s still only lasted seven months the iphone   we bought him last only lasted a year now the iphone   has went out after   months and i can t afford to buy another one so i m hoping to be able to get a replacement since this isn t really acceptable and i can t even find out who the seller is and there s not even a contact seller on where i bought it so i m hoping they still exist if you do please write me back  the amazon guarantee is why i buy these products through amazon and now i realize third parties but still should be able to get this fixed or replaced i just want it replaced,1
1725,the phone was delivered in excellent shape and works fine  battery life is     which seems very good for a used phone  we have not attempted to connect with verizon as we are just allowing our son to use it on wifi for now  overall very pleased ,5
1726,whenever my phone breaks  i usually buy a replacement from someone on craigslist   i thought this would be a safer bet  unfortunately seems not to be the case  probably won t buy from this source again  i ve had it for just a few days  the first day i used it  it kept shutting down at    battery    app open   on day    the thumbprint recognition stopped working  the edges of the screen are also flickering  but it s possibly its some kind of weird refraction thing happening through the glass protector sheet ,3
1727,i was ridiculously nervous  buying this phone online  but to my excitement and relief  it works perfectly  the battery life is pretty good  nowhere near as bad as my last phone was  and the phone as a whole is in good condition  it also receives signal way more easily than my last phone  which is great  i wasn t expecting that ,5
1728,i really love this phone  it s like new   everything is so far great ,4
1729,realizó dos compras compras con ésta compañía  tuve problemas con uno de los equipos pero el vendedor me solucionó excelentemente  y la comunicación fue muy buena ,5
1730,i like that it’s reasonably priced and works like a brand new phone  takes great pictures  finger print option is fast as the phon itself,5
1731,you could tell this phone was kept in a case for a long time  due to  very minor  scratches  the phones battery health was at    which i think is great for a renewed product  this phone has definitely exceeded my expectations ,5
1732,so far its been a good phone haven t had any issues,5
1733,no me funciono la batería se muere rápido ,1
1734,ordered refurbished iphone   in september and so far have been very happy with it  phone was like new when received and was able to use sim from my iphone    set up was smooth no problem at all  great iphone for the price,5
1735,good for the most part  although it said it was top quality there were cracks in the screen  i used this as a trade in and fortunately that did not disqualify it ,3
1736,battery life is a   but super great phone  never cracked out of all the times i dropped it lol ,4
1737,has worked well ,5
1738,noticed the screen was coming loose  decided to open the phone to reset the screen only to find multiple screws loose inside  a total of   screws  different sizes  were lose inside the phone  it is missing the metal plates to protect the battery connections and screen display connections ,3
1739,outstanding  so very happy with the iphone    no muss no fuss just do it  thank me later ,5
1740,just didn t work well   there were times the battery just went almost dead   home button made some crazy i don t no how to explain just trie it you will understand ,1
1741,dislikes   phone sent after being renewed by experts  remained defective and non programable for use   in need to replace lost phone asap and   days later  was sent a defective device  what a disappointment likes   promises a quick exchange via amazon  hopefully received before the set delivery date of the    what happened to next day or same day shipping ,1
1742,the charging cord and the black that the usb charging cord fits into is not working at all  the worst part of the whole process is they say that there a small and local company but you cannot get a hold of them at all  they have a lot of flyers in the box that give you ways to contact them but they don’t answer their phone ,5
1743,i know this is a refurbished product so there s just so much one can really complain about it but the sounds quality on the phone i got was pretty bad  it seem like the speaker is cracking all the time ,3
1744,works like it says,4
1745,finger print reader works well  works as well as a new one ,5
1746,the product is fraudulent  the phone is worthless  it could be used as a paper weight  ,5
1747,it works good but the speaker doesn’t work i can’t hear when i make a call,3
1748,this phone was exactly what i needed  clean imei  unlocked  and untied to the previous owner’s apple id  there were some wear and tear on the screen and the edges  and the battery was at    capacity left  however  for the price i can’t complain ,5
1749,so far it’s like a brand new phone   no issues with set up or anything else so far   great deal  ,5
1750,looks and feels new,4
1751,came sooner than expected and even had a glass protector already on it  clean works great  i’ve got no complaints,5
1752,don’t know if it’s the phone or the last download from apple   but camera and flashlight quit working  ordered the phone in october as a new phone and it quit working in february,5
1753,nice but batteries die quickly,4
1754,overall  the phone came out great  i guess the only complaint i have is it’s charging  it charges fine but it doesn’t stay charged as long as it should  but other than that  very happy with my purchase  fantastic for a refurbished iphone ,3
1755,i bought this for my wife because i had bought one just like it a month ago  mine pretty much set itself up  it was totally painless  she has had this thing since christmas and still can’t get it set up  apparently an update has not be done and because of that it is kinking the whole set up process  however it won’t allow the update to be done now for some reason  beins how this phone is a refurbished maybe that’s the reason it was sent back  i think she has given up on it so it looks like i will need to get involved  i’ll keep you all posted on how it turns out ,2
1756,senior citizen  employer requested upgrade  technologically challenged  didn t need bells  whistles  apps  felt  used refurbished would be acceptable  son assisted with product selection  apple iphone   functionality good  battery recharging frequent  conversations interrupted broken up  reception lost disconnected  request refund  will probably purchase brand new now  thank you ,4
1757,so far this phone from hybrid it has worked great for my grandson   in fact  i am purchasing another phone from hybrid it for another grandson  i am hoping we have the same experience ,4
1758,price was good and having   day return was a bonus  phone worked as described  battery life was    ,5
1759,not sure how it works with a connection but my sim card went right in and it says tmobile i will connect it soon but works fine charges up good,4
1760,still within the warranty period but all good so far  the device was delivered quickly   in “like new” condition ,5
1761,great phone except battery life is very short even with airplane mode phone drains  we’ve tried removing all background refresh too but battery doesn’t last more than an hour ,3
1762,it had a few scratches but it works ok ,4
1763,i just can t understand how to manage this phone   i did not get an instruction manual   this hit and miss system is very frustrating   i wish i did not have to use this phone betty sewell,4
1764,i bought this phone for my daughter for her birthday   it was late but that was not the sellers fault  bad weather came in and delayed it  the phone couldn’t be more perfect for her,5
1765,i gave this as a gift to a friend and he’s really enjoying it it’s just the right size ,5
1766,phone came working better than expected  battery life maximum efficiency was at     not bad for a renewed phone with a   day warranty  no scratches or signs of use or wear and tear,5
1767,great phone  exactly what i wanted  also very fast shipping  phone works perfectly and packaging was very protective  worked with my   sim from my iphone    very happy with this product ,5
1768,nice phone,4
1769,good product ,4
1770,i mean why does anyone need a review   this iphone works great just like every other iphone ever made   since itty is a renewed phone it looks brand new ,5
1771,i purchased the iphone   for my wife   so far it has exceeded all expectations ,4
1772,very happy with how easy my purchase was  great price for a very well functioning refurbished phone  shipped quickly had no damage and everything on the phone works perfectly  thank you  ,5
1773,the phone works great for everything except the ear piece   it works just fine  it’s just hard to hear   everything else  it’s like a brand new phone ,5
1774,battery life was only about   ,4
1775,everything about the phone is fine  the one thing i needed most was being able to make better phone calls and that s what s wrong with it  the microphone is all static and makes it super hard to hear my voice  i need that part for my job and i m out of money to spend on another one  going to have to go get that part fixed  but everything else is pretty good  nothing seems to be wrong with it besides that ,3
1776,it s beautiful   looks new    battery charges fully   i ordered a phone cover for protection   still have to finish getting it set up  then transfer data from old phone  get a new sim card  and learn how to use this new phone   price was right   i found an owner s manual online ,5
1777,me encantó está precioso  lo recomiendo,5
1778,me gusta,5
1779,the only thing i have a problem with is that when i get a call i can’t hear the person on the other end of the phone its very low i tried to adjust the volume but that didn’t do anything,4
1780,the battery can only go to   percent storage,4
1781,it’s in perfect condition  i didn’t see any scratches or scuffs marks  it came i one day earlier than expected  the phone works good too  there hasn’t been any problems with it update  it’s been over a year and it’s still intact and works perfectly  ,5
1782,i just got this phone today  the battery is supposed to be higher than     which is already pretty crappy to be honest  and my battery is only     which is bad     it’s advertised    or above    so why isn’t mine    or above ,3
1783,i bought this phone and was super easy to set up and super cheap    plus the color vibrancy is amazing     never going back to cell phone stores to get an expensive phone that’s just going to glitch    ,5
1784,this is the best  my son loved it he was so happy about it  there is no scratches  no dents no nothing  it doesn t look refurbished it looks bran new  i would definitely recommend this to anyone who s looking to buy a phone  doesn t come with original charger cube but not really affecting how it charges  it charges really fast and runs out really slowly  price is astonishing ,5
1785,i bought this iphone for my nephew  i was hesitant at first because it was refurbished  when it came he was so excited to open it   he loved it   it looked like a brand new phone  there was no scratches on the screen or the phone  he was able to use the phone with no problem   the picture are so clear  this is definitely worth the price ,5
1786,as described everything is good but after using it for   month the phone shutdown but the good thing is they accept the returns  the only good thing to buy on amazon is no hassle  ,5
1787,purchased this “amazon certified” refurbished  i    due to very weak battery and small storage capacity on my phone  the new  to me   phone looks and functions fine but the battery life is no better than what i had in my   year old i   and the supplied charger does not work  i do not stream  watch videos etc and use my phone several times per day for quick texts or app    internet usage totaling less than   hour day  this amount of usage will not get me through the day without recharging  now my dilemma is whether go through the hassle of pulling sim card  wiping the phone clean and sending it back leaving me without a phone  or buying a new battery and just use my old charger ,1
1788,i phone   and i love the color   it works good and is excellence buy ,5
1789,phone came to me near perfect  phone was fully unlocked and had no scuffs on the sides  battery life was at    and the screen had very minor scuff on top right side but completely un noticeable during use  some of the reviews for this product made me uneasy at first but i got a great phone at a great discount,5
1790,at first i wasn’t sure what i was going to get i had a   for a long time and didn’t want to get into a contract to get a new phone getting a used from from amazon has worked great it’s just like getting a new one but not having to pay the price tag  not a scratch on it works great and came with a wall charger and cord,5
1791,it was like a new phone condition as promised and described   happy purchase here ,5
1792,it is really worth it  i ordered a renewed iphone     and luckily and    battery capacity  and the phone is defect less  it looks brand new  it also came with a screen protector and a sim ejector tool  i am extremely satisfied  it is definitely worth spending your money ,5
1793,it looks great i didn t get to use it yet cuz i need help setting it up i m going to get help pretty soon i heard great things about it,5
1794,this iphone   is in great shape  works wsll  and was trouble free to get up and running  you can trust this vendor  ,5
1795,i’m satisfied  wish it had shown the size of it rather than going by a     wish i had gone with the   size if you decide   can you send back and upgrade to the   ,5
1796,the second one was great but the first one i received i have had problems with the camera and flash light since i got it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn’t work    ,3
1797,i ordered this phone because it was a newer version and priced good  when i received the phone everything seemed fine but then i discovered that the camera does not work on it  i have a young daughter and pictures are a big part of my life so very bummed out camera doesn’t work ,3
1798,the phone itself psychically was great and in perfect condition  but after i  got it activated and started receiving calls i  noticed the  volume on the speaker was very low and barely could hear people on the phone  so now i’m going through the process of returning the phone and i’ll write again on my experience with this process  kinda just wanted a exchange but on returning it they say only refunds  fyi  i’m not phone stupid i  did all the steps to fix the issue and it wasn’t something silly from a option on the phone with the volume ,2
1799,so excited about the condition and the ease of set up with this phone   i was hesitant to buy a reconditioned phone from amazon  but it s been great so far   the price was great too   ,5
1800,bought from hybrid it  battery life was expected since the phone is refurbished but other than that the phone works perfectly and exceeded my expectations  great product ,4
1801,bought one and working perfectly fine  no issues,4
1802,besides some very small light scratches on the glass  this phone has performed very well ,4
1803,everything was good except the volume when you have to phone to your ear is way low and i have to put people on speaker to hear them ,3
1804,when i bought this i was skeptical i hate buying used products    they sent the phone it had a charge and they sent the longest charging cable i now own  awesome buy thank you      the only complaint i had was the sim card key wasn’t with it   ,5
1805,                    the media could not be loaded                  happy,4
1806,fantastic phone  fedex sucked at getting us when needed but the seller was very transparent and worked great with us  the seller alone made this worth the buy  fantastic customer service ,5
1807,menos del    de condición de la batería  fui estafado,5
1808,although the phone works  the smell of smoke is extremely strong and makes it unusable   immediately after opening the box the smell was overwhelming and offensive ,1
1809,i will admit that i did not open the box and use the phone until   days after purchase  my wife got during christmas time as it was a good price and gave it to me for vday  that said  it had battery issues right from the get go  unfortunately  it was past the   day window for the amazon warranty  i reached out to the reseller but heard nothing back  long story short  the phone is unusable unless i take it to the apple store and get a new battery  it goes from    to    in a matter of   minutes  battery health from settings says your battery health is significantly degraded and to replace it  this should not happen   days after purchase and honestly in my case   day after actually beginning to use it  stay away from this reseller ,1
1810,it bought it for my father  he liked it very much  the phone looks brand new and totally unlocked  it was packed well and came with cerifited lightning cable ,5
1811,absolutely love this phone  great deal and i haven’t had any of the negatives that some reviews have said  battery life is amazing ,5
1812,short battery life  doesn’t last even a few hours  other than that works ok ,4
1813,battery not charging,1
1814,this was for my brother  terrible  terrible  terrible  a very expensive lessened learned  it will not stay charged and is extremely slow trying to use  i would not order anything from this seller again ,1
1815,so far  so good  looks brand new  works as it should  missing the audio dongle  though  charger and cable not original  but working ,5
1816,units were like new  no scratches  no dings  battery life is great  just make sure you buy from hybrid it i bought another set from a different seller and theirs had scratches and battery was junk ,5
1817,it came as expected  there were some scratches on the edge of the screen that are visible at arms length  but only when the screen is off  so no big problem,4
1818,looks like new,4
1819,i was nervous at first but it was literally the easiest purchase for such a in demand product  i bought the iphone   for my son for the holiday and worried there’d be a sim card issue  nope  the phone was in perfect condition and we stopped by the nearest metropcs and he’s been eat to ear smiles  thank you for making this holiday a smooth one  i may be buying myself one as well   ,5
1820,overall decent piece  although there were some large scratches on the top right of the phone ,3
1821,as described     battery  like new     works great   paid the extra     for the amazon  renewed premium    it was worth it ,5
1822,phone works  but was cracked when received  reported it was cracked  an no one ever reached out me ,2
1823,lo único que no me gustó fue que el dispositivo traía    de batería  me hubiese gustado un    por lo menos ,5
1824,bought the phone for some trade in value but it came with a chip in the frame and wasn’t worth what it could have been  phone seemed to function otherwise ,3
1825,phone is great and works just fine  the only thing that dont work is the power button,5
1826,bought for my daughter and it’s been working great   she can download so many apps without having to worry about her phone slowing down ,5
1827,i had a terrible iphone   that i hung on to for to long   purchased this refurbished    and am so happy   looks brand new and operates like new   love the long battery life   highly recommend ,5
1828,the product seems fine and i would be    satisfied if the phone had come in perfect condition  there are a few small scarrches on screen and one on side of phone  but overall  its functioning so yeah ,3
1829,small impact on the left side corner  other than that the phone is good ,4
1830,hybrid it   owner contacted me checking too why i didn’t like the product  this made me feel very good today  so any negative reviews i may have placed on the iphone please disregard  it just wasn’t the size i was looking forward to  thanks mark for thinking about me enough to reach out for my feedback ,5
1831,the phone was sealed and looked brand new,5
1832,no good,1
1833,love this phone  works great looked new i’ve had it for about a year now  no issues except i’m getting a new battery replaced bc the battery life is at    but otherwise i definitely recommend ,4
1834,works perfect like new,5
1835,everything works as it should,5
1836,phone is in great shape   works well all the features function beautifully  strong signal  battery holds out well will probably be buying another refurbished phone through this company ,5
1837,arrived in a verizon box which threw me since i didn’t order it from verizon   i’m on at t  so i wasn’t even sure if it was going to be fully unlocked for at t  not happy with the confusion but the product is fine and it works ,4
1838,                    the media could not be loaded                  i brought this phone in march   for my daughter to have on our trip we took it was perfect for her… it’s now november   and since then it started falling apart literally like pieces on the phone front and back stared falling off the phone and the screen started acting funny to where it doesn’t work and now i have to get her another phone…so as i said it didn’t last,2
1839,i love this phone  the battery life  touch screen  and camera quality is perfect  i will be    buying this product again in the future  i recommend this to anyone needing a phone but not wanting to spend the high prices ,5
1840,great for teenagers,4
1841,it was in good condition  and the perfect quick and inexpensive replacement option on short notice  aesthetically it was perfect  but sometimes the sound quality isn’t great  otherwise  perfect for the price ,5
1842,the delivery was prompt and the product was not damaged ,5
1843,i had an excellent experience with this product     battery  like new condition  keep it up  would love to purchase again from you all  when i’m looking for quality i’ll check you guys,5
1844,needed to upgrade from   but didn’t need the newest iphone  love not being locked into the contract longer  was able to take my verizon card out of the old one and put it right in the    no activation fee like i would’ve paid in store  battery lasts way longer than the old phone  will come back to repurchase a refurbished phone over a new one when needed,5
1845,perfect,4
1846,i was pretty nervous to buy a refurbished phone on amazon but so far  so good  phone came in perfect condition  no dents  scratches  etc  so far everything seems to be working great  i’ve had it for about a month or two with no issues  this was a much cheaper option than buying or leasing the iphone   from verizon  very pleased with this purchase ,5
1847,it has such a nice battery life  came with a screen protector  and the fingerprint scanner works perfectly  would reccomend ,5
1848,there is no face recognition but other than that solid smooth and a great phone for used,5
1849,like all,4
1850,my iphone i bought   months ago and today it shutdown and no longer working  i’ve reached out to amazon and they were good about the help but there’s nothing that can be done from them  i  would be careful about buying from this company due to they don’t give enough time to return items that stop working or other matters ,1
1851,thanks,4
1852,don’t buy from d’tech they have special restocking fees for some reason it cost    to restock an item  just find someone else who is more customer centric ,4
1853,despite the bad reviews  i purchased this item and i am    satisfied with my purchase  the phone arrived in good condition and took just a few moments to set up ,5
1854,                    the media could not be loaded                  the phone screen is acting up  you can’t slide to answer when phone is locked and letter t and number   don’t work on the keyboard  then the phone will eventually start tweaking and typing all the ts as shown on the video  i will keep the phone for a few more days and see how it goes before i decide to return it,3
1855,i was very surprised by how good the condition of this renewed iphone   is  there is no scratch at all  the battery life is great  it only loses    juice overnight  i love it ,5
1856,don’t waste your money ,1
1857,bought this iphone   for my wife  came in mint condition   nice iphone  swapping over everything from her at t iphone   was easy  everything works wonderfully and my wife is happy  ,5
1858,many people are saying the battery life is bad but i have had it for a month and zero problems  great time connecting to wifi  completely unlocked and isn’t lagging  i was very stressed but it’s great ,5
1859,ease of use,4
1860,it discharge rapidly,4
1861,got it for my grandson  my wife has one and my grandson was familiar with it  it looks and functions like new ,5
1862,i have ordered two phones from them and they are both in top working quality  customer service is on point and very helpful  i am so glad i ordered from them  thank you ,5
1863,the phone may be fine but it was advertised as us cellular compatible   it is not  i had to return it,3
1864,basically  brand  new  clean   no  scratches   screen  absolutely  oerfect,5
1865,loved it  just as expected  no damage at all  battery life is at    so that’s still good  worked great with my t mobile sim card  will definitely purchase from here when i upgrade,5
1866,there is no facial recognition in the edition but it works perfectly  they give you a screen protector already on the phone and it is in mint condition  i highly recommend ,5
1867,super happy with this purchase  it works perfectly and i’ve had absolutely no issues also i have no issue with being able to turn the camera sound on off as i read in comments before purchasing  so i was nervous but i can turn it off and on no problem ,5
1868,i purchased this refurbished iphone   and everything works perfectly fine  only light scratches i seen  but everything else finger code and the phone itself works fine   battery is fine as well    thank you  ,5
1869,i expected some issues due to being reifubished  but not the volume sound going completely out  i don’t get dings when someone message  nor does it ring when someone calls  not to mention the battery drains in   day,3
1870,arrived very quickly  told me that it would arrive in   days  also came with a screen protector already on it  the only thing that i had a problem with it is that there was a few scratches on the glass on the back,4
1871,don’t go by bad reviews  everything as advertised and i’m very happy ,5
1872,just received it and transferred my data from my icloud  phone appears in perfect condition  i even checked around the corners where it could’ve been dropped but it’s flawless  went into the battery status in settings and it’s at    efficiency  for half the price of a new iphone  i can’t justify spending more on my phone than my television  so far so good  but if anything happens to pop up  i’ll update my review ,5
1873,phone looks like it is new  very easy to transfer my iphone   settings and apps to this newer iphone  battery seems to hold a charge much longer than my older iphone   ,5
1874,the phone is too small … can’t find a phone case for it,3
1875,this phone is really good and like new but had issues with the microphone hearing but i changed the hearing speaker and now it is really good apart from that its perfect,4
1876,good product,4
1877,it was an iphone   as advertised  very happy it wasn’t a scam  bought it to trade into att for my new phone and everything checked out  good deal,5
1878,the phone me in great condition  but i found an issue with the call volume  turns out a some iphones could have this issue where the call volume is extremely quiet and can t be raised  the seller accepted the phone back and gave a full refund,5
1879,this phone is in good condition  the fingerprint reader and battery life are both good  it could’ve been cleaned better though  also  would’ve helped to have an actual iphone charger box and cord instead of a knockoff ,5
1880,save yourself some time and money and buy brand new ,3
1881,works with at t wifi calling  battery life is better than my previous phone  takes great photos  it definitely has everything you could need  even for   ,5
1882,one small ding but otherwise great phone for the price  would buy from this seller again,4
1883,has been in use  i feel the appearance is    new  still good  the screen  the speed of operation  standby time is not bad  recommended to buy  or even guaranteed  if you can give a screen protector and protective cover  it is better,4
1884,i want to like this product but the calibration or something is messed up because the camera constantly shakes  i cannot take pictures because all of them shake and come out slightly blurry  also the screen is so sensitive even when the screen is locked  i end up taking pictures while it is in my pocket  the only thing i am blaming the renewal team is the camera  the sensitive screen maybe just on me idk,3
1885,phone works like new and i’ve had no problems with it over the month i’ve had it  there are no visible scratches or cracks  it came with a charger but no head phones which was disappointing because there’s only a lightning port for the headphones  it did also come with a sim card tool so i didn’t have to go to verizon  very pleased overall,5
1886,very bed    everything is slow,1
1887,it was assessed that the microphones were cut when the back plate of the phone was replaced during its refurbishment  another    plus lost time for phone not working  appointments  waiting on parts  and installation  frustrating ,5
1888,everything s good so far ,4
1889,i bought these as a gift for my sister and brother in law  red and black   so far  they said they’re happy with them and that they work well ,5
1890,this phone operates just like a new one  it did not come with original iphone box or ear buds  but it does have a charger  overall very pleased with this phone ,5
1891,the iphone so far hasn t given me any problems  it came with a little spot in the screen on the right bottom  but no major thing  it s a very little one  i liked it so far ,4
1892,works perfectly fine and fast  battery lasts throughout the day  only disliking of it is that it has a small scratch at the bottom near the home button  overall  great phone ,4

1900,amazon asked about face recognition  don t think the   has that so no stars there  generic box  generic charger and cable  tossed those in the trash as i don t trust them but after a week the phone has worked well and we are satisfied  no lightning to headphone adapter ,5
1901,really simple setup…the phone was brand new  too   don’t forget  the iphone   has no ear phone jack ,5
1902,i’ve only had it for one     day so far  but so far so good   looks like brand new  i love it ,5
1903,i love it because i can download all the apps that i want  but hot spot not working properly  very millennial u have to use bluetooth ear pods  ,5
1904,first time getting a refurbished phone   one not from a retailer  so happy we went this route  we haven’t had it long  but so far the phone is working great ,5
1905,compre este teléfono para usar en uruguay con movistar hace   mes aproximadamente el teléfono está como nuevo sin detalles totalmente desbloqueado la batería anda perfecto trajo como dice la publicación el cargador no original me lleve la sorpresa de q no tiene para colocar audífonos tradicionales por lo que compre unos inalámbricos con bt muy satisfecho y súper recomendable por el precio espero siga así muy buena compra ,5
1906,the product looks like new and works fine  my only issues are some scratches on the screen and the earphone speaker sounding kind of muffled  but still great for a renewed iphone ,4
1907,excellent condition iphone  ,5
1908,i ordered two phones  they both look and work like new  i went back and ordered another one  it came pretty quickly and same quality as the first two ,5
1909,i needed to replace my iphone se first generation  this iphone   is a great fit for me at a great price ,5
1910,the phone came with screen scratches  the charger just broke     i am not trying to complain but when anyone orders  please give the proper picture     the charger’s input to the phone broke off     i’m just happy it didn’t get stuck in the phone,3
1911,la bateria estaba en     no es malo pero pense que podria estar mejor  todo funciona perfecto  la caja viene con cargador y adaptador  sin auriculares  funciona perfecto  lo recomiendo,4
1912,the phone stopped charging less than a year after being purchased  but after the   days warranty  unbelievable  but unfortunately for my daughter and me   true   ,1
1913,i got this product for my   year old son  he loves it  it came in great condition  the battery life is better than my iphone    very happy with my purchase,5
1914,the phone was in perfect condition  it charges quickly  and phone activation went smooth  so far it has been working great  ,5
1915,it was amazing fast clean i did not find any marks on the phone and the battery is life is    wow im so amazed,5
1916,the phone that was sent was defective upon receipt  the internal speaker didn t work  i asked for a replacement  the company would not replace their defective phone  they wanted me to replace the phone at my cost and return their defective phone  i cannot go with out a phone for work  i found another phone with a different company and will be returning the defective phone asap  unfortunately they won t be getting my business  i will say the phone was in good shape and seemed to operate great  you just couldn t hear anything unless it was on speakerphone ,1
1917,when i got the phone it honestly looked pretty new to me  no scratches or dents  everything worked perfectly fine  it came with a charger cable and box ,5
1918,was as expected,4
1919,son needed a new phone and we did not want to pay and arm and a leg just to upgrade  this was the perfect solution   much better than what he had     but also reasonably affordable   phone had a tiny minor scratch on the screen but otherwise looked and works like brand new ,5
1920,the phone looks brand new  haven’t been using a lot tho because it’s my second sim phone  was just a bit sad because it never came with earphones as they said it comes with all accessories  otherwise i’m happy with the purchase so far ,4
1921,i was a little hesitant to buy a refurbished phone   my daughter has had it for   months no problems at all  everything was as described  saved me a lot of     ,5
1922,this phone is great  however the next phone i got from this shop wasn’t so you really have to pray for the best  i will say they do refund you if there’s any issue  their customer service is excellent  i just returned the defective iphone   and purchased another iphone   hoping that since i’m paying almost double that it will be exactly like this phone that i’m writing the review about ,5
1923,the phone looks like a new one and works like a new phone,5
1924,the phones i purchased came a day early they look like a brand new phone i was not sure about the reviews but the phones i received are in great condition,5
1925,great value  however the battery performance is at    out of the box   also  no ear pods   otherwise  great value and no cosmetic or other defects with the phone   mine came with a tempered glass protector courtesy of the original owner ,4
1926,i’m very happy with my purchase from this seller  my battery life is at   percent  the phone itself is in     condition  the price was great for an iphone      i was worried that i’d get a phone with scratches and dents on the sides but not in this case  very pleased with my purchase ,5
1927,phone is a bit small but otherwise it’s good,4
1928,everything worked except the charger  the charger only worked one week and it broke,5
1929,i am very happy with this purchase ,5
1930,i will buy more often  i highly recommend it  my iphone   came    functional with    battery and no significant details  funcional no brazil   ,5
1931,good condition,4
1932,product came as advertised and in a very timely manner thank you ,5
1933,works good have had no problems with the phone lol,4
1934,i was surprised at the high price for a phone that came out   years ago  the phone looks like it s in like new condition  it arrived spotlessly clean in an amazon branded box with an aftermarket charger  according to the  battery health  function in the phone  the battery is at    of original capacity  not bad ,3
1935,just thanks  iphone   came with    battery and in close to new condition  i would say to any observer is really new  there is no reasons to complain  i m very satisfied  thanks a lot ,5
1936,i was initially super worried about buying a renewed phone  especially with apple s battery issues  i bought this for my dad  and everything was pretty much new without the apple packaging  the battery life indicator as well as a few apps to check indicated that the battery was at      capacity  which is basically next to new  i am very pleased with it ,5
1937,perfect phone for money spent,4
1938,i like the phone for the price  everything was new and i had no problems transferring my data over  i will have this phone for a couple of years ,5
1939,extremely happy with purchase  currently living overseas and our phones decided to completely die  this phone came in a week and a half early and works perfectly  no scratches  not cracks nothing  completely flawless  digi our phone service provider  was able to get it working within seconds ,5
1940,phone won’t update after not even having it a year  took it to apple store and was told phone is defective  don’t buy from this seller,1
1941,this product came so fast  it was supposed to come wednesday the   but came yesterday  sunday the    there were no scratches or physical issues with the phone the battery was a little low  but it came with an excellent long charger ,5
1942,i have been an android user since cell phones    well a really long time  my daughter convinced me to switch and i am so glad she did  this phone is amazing ,5
1943,no complaints so far,4
1944,this phone is     less that a comparable phone at a  t    t   getting it set up with my carrier was as simple as moving the sim card from my old phone to this phone   once there  all i had to do was get the software upgraded to the latest version of ios and restore from backup   it has worked flawlessly since ,5
1945,i love the battery life,4
1946,this is the second referb iphone i’ve bought from amazon   they work perfectly  and look perfect when you get them   in general electronics either work  or they don’t   so if you’re going to have a problem you’re going to know it right out of the box   my next iphone will be another amazon referb ,5
1947,we got this phone for our babysitter because she goes above and beyond for our family  it was truly worth the price and in      perfect condition  it had two very tiny scratches on the screen  but almost didn t see them  it works great and so far no issues  it s a pretty phone and she absolutely loves it ,5
1948,i ordered   phones and both were in excellent condition  one looked brand new  and the other one had some tiny scuffs on the bezel  they both work really well ,5
1949,minimal side scratches clear perfect screen worked with my verizon carrier and battery is more like at a    but still works really good for it’s price   ,5
1950,it shipped fast and arrived two days before it was supposed to  i upgraded my grandma from a   to an     obviously there’s no changes so she didn’t have to adjust to anything  phone works   looks like new  great buy   she could use it with xfinity mobile  ,5
1951,also iphone   is refurbished,4
1952,i bought three and all of them were like new phone  battery health was from   to    and every thing was working at its best  i recommend this product ,5
1953,i’m satisfied with my phone  had a few issues with the phone freezing up   getting stuck a few times but now it’s moving okay ,4
1954,my iphone showed up   day early  i can barely tell it was used   the battery charged to     and it lasted     hours with moderate use ,5
1955,great seller  very responsive to questions and concerns  dedicated to making sure everything was to my full satisfaction ,4
1956,works perfectly  refurbishment was done well  and it even came with a screen protector installed ,4
1957,perfect for me,5
1958,apple asks you to verify account login with the phone number you originally started your icloud account with and unfortunately for me that was about   numbers ago so i couldn’t gain access to my old purchases or pictures  but the device does its job  you’ll definitely have to take a trip to your mobile carrier to get the sim activated  coming from android phone  good purchase ,5
1959,bought to give for trade in on iphone      i never used it but got    credit ,5
1960,was using an iphone   everyday  and looking to replace my second phone iphone    either buy the latest model or look for second hand and i must say that i am very satisfied  very good condition screen  body  battery     finally made it my primary phone  i recommend this option if like me you dont run powerful apps or dont look for latest trendy equpments,5
1961,honestly everything worked on the phone    it was in perfect condition for being renewed but the camera was the only thing messed up    other than that completely worth it,4
1962,love it will be ordering again when it’s time to upgrade but battery was a little low but it’s okay i can live with it but overall good product,4
1963,overall works really well  the screen was scratched more than i would have liked but not a huge deal ,4
1964,phone is indistinguishable from a new phone  battery capacity at   percent versus a promised minimum of   percent   very happy with purchase ,5
1965,good  like new condition  however  battery life was pretty low at     it s alright though  because the phone is working perfectly ,5
1966,the renewed phone i got only had    battery health  it s only a few   better than my old phone that i used for a couple of years  want to see what others got ,3
1967,buen estado,4
1968,the phone is nice and good condition for a refurbished iphone the battery  life is better than we expected   ,5
1969,i bought the phone for my son and he absolutely loves it  it was delivered very fast and then great condition  i will be back to buy again  thank you,5
1970,maybe i m lucky but this phone arrived in perfect condition  exactly as described   i bought it for my wife whos iphone   was failing   we inserted her sim card and she was up and running   i charged it the night before so we ll see how the battery lasts but so far so good ,5
1971,so far so good and i’m on it all the time  ,5
1972,felt and looked like a brand new phone  changed my sim card and it worked instantly with no hassles  battery health     great deal ,5
1973,doing good so far,5
1974,a little on the pricey side but it is a great phone easy to use and add or remove apps i like it  i would suggest it to others looking for a great phone ,4
1975,i was hesitant at buying this at first but when it came i was so happy  it delivered very fast and it came in looking brand new  the fingerprint had trouble working if your hands are wet or greasy but that isn’t much of a problem  it works very good and the battery life is amazing  it lasts all day long ,5
1976,purchased two iphones to turn into at t to take advantage of their    credit towards and iphone    both phones came in excellent condition with chargers included ,5
1977,i like  that unlike my previous iphone   that i can go all day on one charge  and also like the   of storage  i love to have movies ready for doctors visits  ,5
1978,i received my product on       and it upon opening my package  everything seemed okay  i went to turn on the phone and it seemed dead  no biggie  i could charge it and it’ll work  wrong the first red flag  the plastic covering on the charger was loose and came off of the metal attachment to the chord  i was able to slide it up and down the actual wire second red flag  i had put the phone on the charger and left for about   minutes  expecting my newly unboxed purchase to be nearly charged  wrong the phone didn’t even turn on  i had it charging for two hours  tried multiple power up techniques  all to no success  my phone is faulty  it’s just a lifeless piece of glass and metal i won’t get into the shipping because that’s another story  but after shipping delays and paying additional shipping charges  it’s a little frustrating receiving a phone i can’t even use  i will be returning the device tomorrow and will not be ordering from this seller again i should have taken the negative reviews seriously  maybe if there wasn’t a pandemic my order would have been fulfilled  but i can’t take that chance again ,1
1979,it looks good  with a few scratches so far so good i haven’t notice any problem ,4
1980,the phone proximity sensor and camera didn’t work right  no problem with return so gave them a   star for easy return or it would have been   star ,3
1981,when i answer my phone the volume is very low   i can barley hear throughout the speaker everything else is great    ,4
1982,i bought this phone for as a trade in for an at t trade in offer   the phone looked brand new and worked fine for the short time i had it before it was traded in ,5
1983,i should have known better  as soon as i tried to turn the phone on to set it up  there were problems  the phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home power buttons i finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence  i was mistaken  and began to set up the phone  the phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night  again  i blamed it the amount of data i was transferring from my old phone   mistaken again i used the phone for a few days  and it reset or shut down probably an average of   times a day  sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons  touching  or even my attempts to force it to shut down  i would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again i ended up returning the phone  and asked to exchange it for one that worked  the company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead  now i am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one  i will not be buying this phone ever again and i recommend that you don t either ,1
1984,i m very satisfied with the product  there is no scratches or any cosmetic issues  it s like a new phone with screen protection film  and headphone works great with charging adapter ,5
1985,it’s exactly what i expected and it came with a screen protector ,5
1986,phone arrived along with the charger and cable   works fine and good value for the money ,5
1987,stated it’s compatible with verizon  it’s not ,3
1988,the phone has issues  but the service on this phone from my vendor was incredible and i was shocked   not sure if they get credit in this review but they are legit ,5
1989,product is just as described  no frills about it  it is an iphone    batter is as described  the phone works and looks great ,5
1990,use for facetime  very ok,3
1991,it did not came as gold as i would want  also  battery life is not as good as blackberry keyone  but is faster in processing  does not freeze on multitasking and you can sync everything  or almost everything  from another apple iphone or ipad ,4
1992,the phone works great  it was dirty when i received it  i had to thoroughly clean it before i could set it up to use ,5
1993,battery health    its bad ,3
1994,this phone seems to have some unresolved issues  the volume button sometimes worked  other times not at at all  the screen shot performed very inconsistently and the phone would all of a sudden run out of battery  even though it said it still had    or more  i did not want to keep this phone any longer to find out what other trouble it would give me  i m returning it after using it a little over a week ,2
1995,phone speaker did not work and battery life was super low would still recommend,5
1996,i just got my   iphone   today so i will wright a new review if anything changes but as of now i am extremely happy with the phone there is only   tiny pretty much microscopic scratch that you can only see if you look real close but over all i am very impressed with the seller “buyspry”,5
1997,fantastic camera  terrific pictures i can take with this   i have had no problems buying from the seller any of the phones i’ve purchased from them  i even returned one that was not compatible and got a complete refund,4
1998,since i received the phone it has not pass    charging,1
1999,my   year daughter needed a phone and she likes the smaller one with lots of gb  but i constantly had to buy new cables  i wasn t expecting to have to buy a new iphone every xmas  it will no longer charge and it is searching for a network  it will go to    and then turn off  this time i will buy a brand new one ,2
2000,good,4
2001,n a,4
2002,literally ordered this on        received by      beautiful phone  no scratches and just   small light spots on the screen  my daughter was able to plug it up and we took it to the be official registred with our phone carrier  phone didn t hold a charge long  but we thought this was due to the phone needing to be charged  just arrived that day    by the next day we realized that the phone would not stay on without being on the charger  tried another iphone charger  not the one that came with the phone   phone stayed on while off the charger  until you pressed the screen   instantly cut off   took it to the apple store for what i thought might be a battery replacement  but after diagnostics the problem is the device won t power on the logic board  brain   so the device simply won t power on correctly  recommends new phone   wtf now i have to send this back for a refund   there is no way that this company couldn t have known this if apple picked up on it in   minutes ,1
2003,this phone arrived looking brand new   awesome   had a problem with a black screen  called company   no response from them yet   solved the problem myself   that is my only complaint ,5
2004,arrived early and in very good condition with a nice screen protector on it  very easy transition from old phone to new one ,5
2005,it is a waste of money it won t let you download any apps without doing it from a computer an upgrade version  i really regret buying this for my son now when it won t even work i think i am just get a refund on it ,1
2006,i am a little disappointed with the functioning of the touch screen only   battery life was at   percent when i received phone but after a month i began to notice little quirks in the touch screen   most often not responding to touch  since replacement was   bucks   this phone proved a bit more costly than what i originally would have liked ,3
2007,phone worked really well  i was worried about ordering re furnished  but it’s been great ,5
2008,i liked the phone  but i ordered an iphone instead of an android  my mistake  how can i return this phone so i can exchange it ,5
2009,supposed to be excellent condition  could hear calls  they returned with no problems,1
2010,zero stars on battery life     my battery started acting up just outside the   day warranty period at about     i thought it was a software issue at first and just simply did an all reset and phone worked again  the phone would repeatedly shut down for no reason  i got it to limp along for another   months  thinking all along it was software   recommend returning your item immediately if you notice any glitching  the apple solutions you find will recommend resetting software  a battery issue is a last resort  so beware  if you buy from this amazon reseller  recommend getting a battery test with geek squad immediately    i bought a new used phone on backmarket com  they give a   warranty and have better prices in my opinion ,1
2011,the phone looks amazing can’t wait to use it ,5
2012,what more can i say it’s an iphone  the battery life is lacking a little ,5
2013,i probably wouldn t recommend this purchase based on my experience and recent reviews  i thought this seller had high enough ratings to proceed  but please listen to the conflicting information on this page because i now regret throwing money away  i should have known when i opened the box and found a roku usb wall connector  it looked like someone packed the box with things from home   this phone will not let me set it up and keeps freezing  it keeps saying it can t verify my apple credentials  but i checked and my password id is correct  there is a negligible small ding in the bottom corner of the phone  so it appears to have been dropped  not sure if this is the problem of not ,2
2014,its an iphone good product battery could be better,4
2015,i ordered   and had to send one back because it wasn’t unlocked as advertisedgot money back pretty fast tho   the same weekthe other   were perfect,3
2016,what i don t like is this unlock phone didn t work with my service provider and i m working on sending it back for full refund,1
2017,the first one i received had a defective speaker the replacement is fine,3
2018,just got it       no visible damage or use of any sort  phone turned on immediately camera  finger and sims card worked great  might update in the future ,5
2019,shipped ups the same day i placed my order  looks brand new not a scratch on it  connected with my carrier and so far works great  very pleased    ,5
2020,i get that the phone is “renewed” but the speakers are busted  sound quality is horrible and the bottom speakers don’t work everything else is working fine ,3
2021,i was nervous to buy a used phone on here because of some of the other reviews but i was very pleasantly surprised  the phone looks almost brand new  a few tiny scratches on the screen but nothing crazy   the battery life is at    as well  very happy with my purchase ,5
2022,ok,4
2023,the product feels brand new  sometimes i forget that i purchased a refurbished phone  the only thing i do wish they included is a pair of headphones  other than that i am completely satisfied with this purchase  battery life is great  and the phone has not slows down at all  if your coming from an iphone se or   i would say this is your best bang for your buck ,5
2024,personal,4
2025,this quit working completely within   months   the battery health was under      the earpiece speaker was blown and just overall not in the condition they claimed it was in   the phone now no longer works and when we took it to have it looked at the screws were completely stripped and it could not be opened without destroying the screen to fix it   it no longer turns on due to a manufacturing defect with these phones and should have been checked with apple before it was sold ,2
2026,device was ok   no original power cord and the battery was running out fast ,4
2027,como lo esperado  ,4
2028,battary life is okay as long as it’s not under    then it shuts off every five mins the fingerprint reader is wounder full  haven’t tried the face thing jet ,3
2029,standard iphone   working great only thing it came in a box that said mobile device phone on it total knock off really cheesy and the headphones and charging stuff was gone it was also very clear that it was refurbished,4
2030,had an issue with the first phone but the company quickly resolved my issue and sent me a replacement in record time   i was more than happy with the service and with the phone  highly recommend ,5
2031,very satisfied  thank you,4
2032,everything was fine with the phone for the first three months  after the warranty and return window closed  the microphone died  apple does not fix microphones for the phone so the only option is to replace the entire phone or upgrade to a new device  so if you’re going to purchase a refurbished phone  please purchase the apple support subscription ,1
2033,el iphone esta en excelente condiciones  mejor de lo que esperaba   funciona perfectamente en chile y lo mejor es que su batería esta al    ,5
2034,i liked how goos condition the phone was in  its really fast and works really good ,5
2035,bought it a few months ago  supposedly refurbished  but i think it was new   love it  for those who don t want to overspend  i believe it has the same processor as the iphone models through   ,5
2036,going from a   to this worth the purchase this will last me a while and came in very good condition highly recommended especially if you have something older,5
2037,awesome,5
2038,after three tries i finally got an i phone   that works ax it’s should out ic the gate i’ll let you know i    mo but so far excellent btw a mason is just so good at making it rightthank you amazon,5

2043,ordered this phone reconditioned  this phone looks absolutely brand new  so nice   great deal  ,5
2044,the phone is fine but i paid extra for it to be shipped on a tuesday and it got here thursday afternoon  the battery after being fully charged lasted about   hours  my previous galaxy phone’s battery lasted me all day  so   idk i haven’t owned an i phone in so long i can’t compare it to other iphones  i am still getting used to it ,3
2045,works well ,4
2046,great folks to work with  i can t say enough good things about buying an iphone from hybrid it   ,5
2047,this was a xmas gift for my daughter and man  if i didn t know better i d think it was brand new  mint condition  i highly recommend this seller and product,5
2048,still gets all the updates to ios  large screen  great battery life  good cameras and all the tech you d want for  at the moment  way under     so happy i did this instead of get an x or anything new which right now is more than double  my particular refurbished unit came with an aftermarket  but still very fast  charger and cable ,5
2049,excellent condition  and am very happy with the refurb on this phone,5
2050,i love the phone but disappointed that the charger burnt out the first day for some reason   dies kinda fast but it’s okay i can manage that  ,5
2051,works great  no issues whatsoever   i ve had it about a week so far and it looks and performs just as good as a brand new phone ,5
2052,only been using reserviced model for less than a week  so far so good  arrived before scheduled date  also as described  no extras ,4
2053,honestly was scared to buy this phone not knowing anything about if it would work with a government sim and it did ,5

2068,i like the phone  i found that i had to completely power off the phone  before it would take a charge  the battery is now at    ,5
2069,the phone was refurbished  it came looking brand new   even had a screen protector  i’ve been a samsung user from the get go of cellphones and still getting used to iphone  the one feature i really don’t like abut iphone is the keyboard   having to keep switching back and forth  oh well can’t have everything i guess  i would recommend the seller highly ,5
2070,phone arrived earlier than expected and was in great shape phone works like brand new ,5
2071,i have the phone almost a month   i haven t mastered the fingerprint id but i m pretty sure i just am not doing it correctly   at this point i m very pleased with my purchase ,4
2072,tried to contact company with no response so had to go to apple and you know what that like  problem got fixed without the help from company,4
2073,bought this for my   year old after his iphone   died  i m very impressed a week in  no blemishes  battery life is very good  and it was easy to transfer everything off his old phone by sim card and itunes ,5
2074,i bought this mobile three weeks back  it looks like a brand new one and everything was good until the screen started getting stuck  now and then it stuck depending on the usage  it is bit noticeable  otherwise it is good ,3

2079,touch screen and camera,4
2080,the phone is in an absolute great shape  brand new and everything  however  after getting into it my phone is constantly restarting for no apparent reason  it s even more confusing when there s no data on it either ,4
2081,like new andvworks great   no trouble with service after inserting sim card,5
2082,i bought this iphone for my daughter and so far have been very pleased  it looks brand new and works great  i also saved a lot of money going with a refurbished phone ,5
2083,battery life on this iphone is very poor   it needs charging every   hours with very little use very disappointed in the quality of this phone     would very much like a replacement phoneor at the least replacement battery ,3
2084,compre un iphone   re manufacturado y revisado  se supone que ha sido revisado y el parlante frontal llego defectuoso  se escucha ronco y no se entiende bien lo que dice la otra persona  cuando lo recibí la habian bajado el volumen para que no se notara el daño en un claro gesto de deshonestidad  sabían que el parlante estaba malo y no lo arreglaron ,3
2085,it came in great shape and it even came with a screen protector that is already on the phone  phone worked really good thanks amazon ,5
2086,so far the product has performed well  the phone arrived earlier than projected  great customer service ,5
2087,everyday use  battery use much better than the last phone i had,5
2088,the battery life  touch screen and camera quality are all great  i especially like the ease of setup  less than   minutes  i’m a return customer and i look forward to more purchases in the future  ,5
2089,got this iphone   as a replacement and it has no problems came with screen protector on it  and there was no problems setting it up  no cracks an actuall functioning phone  love it,3
2090,this is the third back up phone i ve purchased  the   in iphone is my favorite secondary phone  excellent purchase ,5
2091,great phone for work ,4
2092,bought it renewed  it came in absolutely  surprisingly great condition for the price i paid  legit i am in awe  no returns today  i’m a happy camper and i’m extremely tough to satisfy   ask my wife lol,5
2093,iphone was in excellent condition   the cord did work and i contacted the company and they quickly sent a new one via fed ex in two days,5
2094,battery was at    so still a low a  charger cable is not supported in one orientation so it might as well be an expensive micro usb  overall a good purchase and i would recommend a renewed iphone purchase and this vendor to my oppulence challenged peers ,5
2095,product was good  exactly as described   only problem was the delivery company and trying to track down my package and sign for it   took   attempts ,4
2096,just arrived   very fast shipping   thank you   seems to be in great condition for being renewed   everything works well so far ,5
2097,like new  easy set up,5
2098,i love the color it’s like a rose gold  easy to use  easy to transfer my information from my old phone  the only problem i have is when it’s turned completely off i have to plug it in to restart it,5
2099,working very good ,4
2100,looks and acts like a brand new phone i have to say i’m completely satisfied,5
2101,had issues with sound and battery  exchanging for another one working good good service thanks so much for fixing these issues i would recommend this seller to anyone ,5
2102,i bought one and immediately the battery wouldn’t even last   hours  sent it back and the   one lasted a week longer than the incredibly short warranty  it stopped recognizing the sim card  tried having it fixed but was told that it’s garbage and repairs would be more than i paid for it  don’t waste your money,1
2103,i love it  it does everything it says it will and probably more that i don t even know  it saved me about      on the exact same thing had i bought it through my carrier   that s a win  win for me   vendors follow up was above and beyond   thank you ,5
2104,the only thing that was wrong it needs update of ios can only do this if you have wifi at home as well,5
2105,phone came in like new condition  no visible wear anywhere  all features working  got exactly what i wanted in a phone for     the price of the verizon store  definitely would recommend if you’re looking to upgrade your iphone on a shoestring budget ,5
2106,great replacement phone in excellent overall condition ,5
2107,battery defective  after   mo      days   ios says to replace the battery   but apple store declines to service it because it is defective    it is  missing tabs  on the battery  and has illegal parts installed ,1
2108,the product came a day before  o  easy data transfer from other iphone   descriptions were pretty accurate  condition of the phone looks brand new  battery health    though not know how long the charge lasted since l needed a     screen—error on my part   returning the product ,5
2109,camera not working properly   fuzzy and hazy cannot take pic,3
2110,not too many scratches  screen quality is great and looks new ,5
2111,this is safer than buying off of facebook market place  craigslist  offer up and even letgo  you don’t have to worry about the phone not working or a bad imei number or even damage to the device  amazon offer you that extra security  i am very pleased with this purchase ,5
2112,i now have bought multiple   for family members from this site   all graded out over    on battery health  which was the major consideration for the upgrades from older iphones ,5
2113,this phone is spotless  just received it today   tested all the features  everything is in good working condition and does work with verizon  love it  also  other reviews stated it was a fake iphone  which is not true  it has a real imei number that matches  however  i do not have information on the long term quality of the phone yet ,5
2114,i was scared to buy this with all the bad reviews but the phone itself turned out fine  i dont see any issues and everything is just the way it should be  i ll update my review if anything happens ,5
2115,very great condition  battery life may be slightly low mine was in the   which i’m alright with but phone is in great condition otherwise,5
2116,phone came back in good shape good shipping battery life was ok fingerprint reader worked all in all good phone for the price i am happy with it it’s been my phone for the last year almost,5
2117,it s been a year since i purchased this iphone   and i ve only been actually using the phone for the last   months  the battery began losing a full charge in less than an hour and then it began expanding and broke the case  i shouldn t have paid almost   dollars for a phone that couldnt even make it a year  let alone   months of semi regular usebasically this vendor willfully sold a faulty product  with iphone batteries being extremely well known for expanding and exploding  the batteries should be the first thing replaced,1
2118,i love it works great looks great just what i wanted very happy,5
2119,bothers me that it says  remanufactured by valutech  on the back  at least put an accurate image on the product page ,4
2120,i was very impressed  with this phone  it is impeccable  not a scratch  it looks perfect  and brand new  it operates  perfectly  so far   it is fully unlocked  i have straight talk wireless  which uses a t and t  no issues at all ,5
2121,the iphone works as expected and as advertised  thank you ,5
2122,everything is good except the battery evaluation was at    right out of the box   renewed should be    chargeable ,3
2123,he hasn’t used face recognition or the finger print reader   he resists technology  lol  battery life is good ,5
2124,we bought this as a replacement for my daughters phone  she loves it  it was easy to set up  fingerprint reader is perfect  very happy with our purchase from here  ,5
2125,bought this phone for my mom and after   months it messed up from the listening audio  she has to put calls on speaker to hear otherwise you can t hear the other person  disappointed  for not getting my mom a new phone ,2
2126,looks like new  works like new  and great price  bet way to upgrade  thanks,5
2127,this iphone don’t offer face recognition   the battery life sucks but all in all it’s a nice phone for a great price,5
2128,the phone looks perfect  and i bought an unlocked version and it worked perfectly with my verizon network  came with an aftermarket charger  but quite honestly it’ll probably last longer than an apple charger  as long as the phone holds up this review will stay good  if it craps out i will come back and update ,5
2129,the phone was great  the service was great  just had trouble with verizon helping us to convert the phone so my daughter could use it   thank you though ,4
2130,it needs to be rebooted often    would not buy again,3
2131,the renewed iphone   arrived with no visible scratches  dents or blemishes   the battery life is excellent and every button and feature is in perfect working condition   i couldn t be happier with this purchase   now i have retroactive buyer s remorse   i wish i had bought my  last  phone as an amazon renewed product ,5
2132,i got a clean phone  works great  i would definitely buy again next time i need another phone,5
2133,this phone is in perfect condition  just like a brand new phone but for a better price  absolutely no issues and works with cricket ,5
2134,these refurbished phones cost way to much to be in the condition that they are  the iphone   i bout looked almost brand new but the battery life is horrible and the volume button doesn’t work  now i have to go through the hassle of waiting on a refund with no phone  don’t waste your money ,5
2135,amazing quality  looked new  was not reported stolen  got iphone   as expected i ordered this as att is doing a promo turn in iphone   get iphone   for free which i did thanks ,5
2136,unfortunately fully unlocked does not mean fully unlocked  will not work with my carrier due to my carrier is cdma network not gsm   looked like a great phone ,3
2137,this product is good but what was cheaped out was that the phone literally dies after it is unplugged  and the finger print doesn’t work either  but other than that  everything is the same as the iphone   ,3
2138,la batería se descarga fácilmente a lo largo del día incluso dejando el celular en modo de avión  con un uso moderado es necesario cargar la batería antes de las   horas  le llegué a cambiar la batería y sigue haciendo lo mismo ,3
2139,i rarely write reviews but i had to for this one  i got it as a birthday gift and it is amazing  no problem at all no scratches basically new besides packaging  came quick and is so much more affordable compare to the price on apple  would buy again  go for it if your not sure,5
2140,not sure it’s been   days however it arrived in time with no scratches on it an looked new    it’s to early to confirm if it is mechanically sound    so far so good,4
2141,came earlier than expected  and in almost new condition  i was expecting an t mobile phone and that’s exactly what i got  my son is happy  so am i ,5
2142,there were a few small blemishes on the back of the phone that were only noticeable if you look really close   otherwise no scratches  dent  or anything else customers mentioned on either of the two phones that i ordered   it came with a real apple charger not a knockoff and the phone itself worked perfectly   i saved    over buying a new phone and am super happy ,5
2143,it’s being used as a backup phone  it works great ,5
2144,the phone was evwrything i needed it to be  it was super easy to activate and i had no issues doing so  it was a christmas present for my   year old  which upgraded her from a    to an    the number one thing on her list  and she is extremely haopy about her  new  phone  ,5
2145,when buying this iphone i was nervous because i never bought a phone from amazon but it was a good purchase ,5
2146,a really nice refurbished iphone   for a great price  we have had it about a month with no issues  good battery life and phone was in great condition ,5
2147,my brother say s he loves the phone he is still working with it,5
2148,have been using for over a month now  the battery life is great  the finger reader works like new  had no scratches on either side  would buy again,5
2149,the phone keeps running hot,4
2150,this phone is great  i got tired of my pixel ly lg camera but i was scared the phone would mess up after a week or so  it did no such thing  the only thing that was a little weird was how fast the battery went down  but after talking to friends i figured out it’s just an iphone thing ,5
2151,its good but for some reason   out of the   i bought just turned off on me within   months and hasn t turned back on  idk what to say but i wish i could get my money back,4
2152,just had to take out the sims card from old phone and we were on our way   phone looks great   it seems to have no blemishes or defaults for renewed phone   happy so far ,4
2153,battery doesn t last for at least   minutes,1
2154,this phone looked like new and works great   good battery life  all functions work and updates automatically with no issues ,5
2155,crap,1
2156,i would expect a brand new battery as well as cleaned speakers  the speakers were full of gunk  affecting sound quality for the most used feature the phone disappointed to have to figure this out on our own ,3
2157,the phone works great but i was disappointed with the amount of chips and scratches on the screen  i understand that i was ordering a refurbished phone but chips and large scratches on the screen are intolerable in my opinion  rather than send it back to seller and wait another week for a different phone  i just bought a new screen and replaced it myself  no other issues,3
2158,i m still pleased  i wish my print was easier to scan  i still have to enter my pin less than     the time  you can t go wrong with    leave your apps open and the battery goes down  what s new  install the wrong app and it s even faster  so much info can move the battery for sure ,5
2159,it was well described on the description  it got shipped fast like i think i didn’t wait that long to receive it ,5
2160,the phone is in a good condition and feels like new  but  the battery health is    which disappointed me  i need to charge it more than once daily ,3
2161,it came with no scratches or cracks looks like its brand new it also came with an original apple charger  which was unexpected but the only downside is that the charger that it came with didn’t work ,5
2162,i would like to say i bought this phone and it worked great at first  i used it for   days then i plugged it into the charger like normal i come back and it won t turn on  keep in mind i did not do anything drastic to this phone before  then after a while it randomly turns on then works for   minutes and shuts off  i am currently trying to get it fixed  i would recommend saving up for a new phone ,2
2163,i have never been happier than this for buying an electronic device at a good price that i felt it s worth the price ,5
2164,bought an at  t locked phone  fully paid  battery compromised  hoping to use as a backup  but turns out after a waiting period to unlock  all eligibility fulfilled    at t can t id this as an at t phone  so it has a suspicious origin  stolen in all probability  and cannot be unlocked  ever   so save your money   don t buy from amazon refurbished store  and certainly not from  buyspry seller ,1
2165,it did not work  powered on went immediately back off,1
2166,la vida de la bateria estaba a    lo cual es muy buena para ser un movil de segunda mano ,5
2167,for     i cannot imagine the quality getting any better  charging port is functioning  touch screen is flawless  and fingerprint reader hasn’t messed up once  battery life is a tad bit worse than i expected  but that’s the only complaint  set up and put in my verizon sim card and it was ready to go ,5
2168,good phone  it didn’t come with the og iphone box but it’s okay the phones what you want anyways  overall this phone is literally like factory new  no issues at all so far and it works great  definitely recommend  this iphone was    and i got it for    here ,5
2169,excellent and awesome product  arrived early and was in very good shape  i will definitely buy again from this seller,5
2170,the phone works really well  the phone came in good condition and no complaints ,5
2171,i received the product in the mail today early  the charger works extremely fast  the phone chargers fast  and it has very few scratches  i would recommend  i have only have the phone for a day ,4
2172,love iphone,5
2173,no issues so far  phone is in good condition and battery health is    which is fine ,5
2174,i still getting to know the phone but  so far i am very happy ,5
2175,love it,4
2176,el teléfono se recibió en buenas condiciones  pero tuvimos que comprar un cargador nuevo porque el que trajo no servía ,3
2177,recording,4
2178,i didn t like that it didn t come with a sim card now i have to go to the store to purchase one ,4
2179,phone ,4
2180,i give this se   a   stars rating after a month ownership so far ,5
2181,screen a little small but otherwise  great phone,5
2182,it s not in as good of condition as i would have liked  charging is iffy  charges sometimes and other times it does not ,2
2183,couldn’t even tell this phone was once used and refurbished  i bought it for my   year old son to replace his broken iphone   and he loved it,5
2184,i wouldn’t buy a “renewed” iphone again  mine was apparently pre owned by someone in a scandinavian country and still tries to revert to norwegian  or whatever  frequently  the ring tone won’t “stick” no matter how many “experts” say “let me do it ” so i never hear it ring  but it’s useful as an emergency phone and for texting ,2
2185,this product came looking brand new i love it thank you so much y all should totally buy this,5
2186,i love this upgrade to an   from a    the phone was delivered sooner then expected  the quality of the phone i’d have say is very close to new  the only thing i don’t like is the battery gets hot when playing a game but that otherwise i’m happy with my purchase ,5
2187,product well restored,4
2188,i love the fact that the company makes sure that your order is correct and shipped off very quickly ,5
2189,loved the price and and quality of the device   ,5
2190,el producto venía en muy buenas condiciones  funcionando al    y hasta con una mica para proteger la pantalla que venía instalada mi única observación es que el auricular para hablar por teléfono venía con una capa de tierra adherida que tuve que remover para poder escuchar bien las llamadas  pero era solamente un tema de limpieza más que de funcionalidad ,5
2191,amazing   highly recommend   i got it despite all the bad reviews and i’m glad i did  works like a     hundred dollar phone ,5
2192,got my iphone   on april   and it was like new no scratches and no damaged to the phone and works great,5
2193,for younger user s this is probably just fine  but for a user who is new to the technology and a bit older this phone needs a user s guide ,3
2194,i bought this phone one year ago and it has already started giving me problems    sometimes the screen will just lock up  other times the voice recorder doesn t work   just the same problems i had with my other phone   wouldn t order again ,2
2195,mine has what looks to be a couple of fingerprint smudges under the glass from when it was refurbished  other than that annoying thing the phone works great ,4
2196,it was a christmas present she’s pleased i’m pleased,5
2197,i purchased this phone for my daughter august   the batter went dead  phone wouldn’t charge no matter what charger we used        so i took it into best buy whom confirmed after running a diagnostic it needed a replacement batter which was fine  i was willing to pay for the replacement batter but after they had open the phone up to put the replacement batter in i was shocked to get a call from them that they could not replace the batter due to the battery currently in the phone was super glued in and there were missing components like screws  adhesive around the display and missing cowling  as you can see i have not had this phone for even a year and to be sold something that is just not all there and made to work for a short period of time is insulting  i have paper work and documents of best buy’s finding  if i can give it a negative star i would ,1
2198,highly recommend purchase ,4
2199,excellent service  they mailed the phone for my daughter that needed it to do her school work and was distressed about her phone breaking   very satisfied  phone looks and functions like an absolutely brand new phone  ,5
2200,phone looks and has been working  for a few weeks  perfectly  physical condition was      set up was easy  charged it for about   hours and inserted my sim card  everything transferred right away  no technical or battery issues  would buy again,5
2201,buyer beware  the phone arrived really looking great  almost unblemished however it started having screen issues i e  dark screen  sadly  right after the   day warranty expired  i ve bought this for my aging mother in law that lives far from me  i ve had my reservations prior to purchasing it for this simple fact but i thought i d take a chance and hope the seller would be helpful if something does happen but clearly that s not the case  so if you don t want the headache and money to burn  don t do it ,2
2202,phone came   days earlier then expected  surprisingly  had literally no sign of wear  just a tiny scratch that was barely visible on the side   the phone has been working great for me so far    days  and it was a breeze getting it registered with my cellular company  keeping my fingers crossed that it stays this way ,5
2203,replacement phone  works well   print too small ,5
2204,fantastic customer service   i bought   of these by mistake  t mobile said my employees phones were iphone    they turned out to be iphone    same as these customer service took them back with no problems  now i need another pair of newer phones ,5
2205,battery dies quickly,3
2206,bought this item for my sister she likes the phone except the battery life  disappointing  camera doesn’t have the same options as the   plus ,4
2207,    would recommend this product  it took less then a week to arrive and when it did it looked brand new in mint condition with a screen protector on  the fingerprint reader works perfectly and it came a brand new charging cord and charging box which both work perfectly  over all this product is definitely worth the price ,5
2208,i ve bought several  renewed  phones over the years and this was the first that was visibly damaged with a scratched screen   one scratch about     long   the battery is showing as able to charge to    of its original capacity  which is prety good for an older phone  but again not as good as i ve had in the past   delivery and functionality are all great ,3
2209,the phone physically was in great shape  the battery however doesn’t seem like it’s holding a charge long enough,3
2210,great product at a very reasonable price  love the space i got for my upgrade  arrived on time and perfect condition ,5
2211,phones came on time  both were in good condition  was able to activate both on metro by t mobile service ,5
2212,i suspect the phone had been previously reported stolen or missing and i could not get my service provider to activate it  they confirmed it was unlocked  but no matter what it said to my service providers it was not updated even when it was and also in the settings the phone itself would show the service provider of the sim card and say  phone not allowed  i m returning it and trying another phone from elsewhere ,1
2213,dies quicklynicely madescratches easilybut as far as productivity works great,4
2214,i like how easy it was to switch out the sim card and set it all up  seamless  really appreciate that they include the tool for removing the sim card  fast delivery  phone in beautiful shape ,5
2215,it is a very good and fully working device  i am happy with the product  the only thing is that it did not come with headphones or earphones  but not a big thing ,4
2216,i got a nearly brand new phone  it is definitely    worth the upgrade from the    nearly everything about the phone is better  it didn’t come with the headphones or a headphone jack adapter though  so make sure you get that too  this was an incredible deal being as the iphone   goes for twice the price from apple ,5
2217,phone doesn’t work we tried several companies and many tech support,1
2218,el sistema operativo me quedó debiendo muchísimo   no es ios y más parece android ,5
2219,this is a great phone and the price was great  i am very pleased as well as my child ,5
2220,good phone didn’t notice any blemishes bought for my daughter as a starter phone battery is good everything works even came with a screen protector,5
2221,when facetime is on other person can’t hear me  lots of static when it’s on speakerphone  would like to return ,3
2222,i like this phone for the size  i don’t like big phones that look like tablets,5
2223,product had no visible damage  it works well— sound  camera  touch screen  etc  i was worried seeing some other reviews  but i am happy with the product ,5
2224,the phone came to me with a battery health of     went to local cpr phone repair and they changed out battery for      ,4
2225,i received my phone   i can say acceptable less scratch but the battery health   service     i paid big amount to replace in apple authorized service center,3
2226,this thing sucks  i’m pretty this is my second pos phone from these people  the speaker is really quiet in the ear piece  basically have to use speaker phone always  randomly just shuts itself off that’s always cool too  seller has been a pain since reached out about it,1
2227,phone won t charge past    the drops quickly  i wrote to seller and never received a response  i will be sure to share this with everyone i know  bad product  bad service ,1
2228,the phone came with a glass screen protector  and the phone is overall in amazing shape  the only flaw i found was the battery health was only    in the settings  however  being this is a used phone  i really have no major issues with it ,5
2229,it came in very good condition  with a few scratches and a small scuff on the aluminum but entirely functional,4
2230,work as new,4

2234,do recommend and will buy again ,5
2235,after two bad iphone purchases on ebay  both refunded  and no luck finding a decent iphone   on gazelle i was hesitant to order another pre owned iphone  however  this iphone was as advertised  mint condition  excellent battery life and yes  it was actually an unlocked  model    dropped in my metropcs sim card and was up and running immediately  good purchase and would buy again ,5

2242,i’ve never in my life cared to write a review  once the phone came in it was in great condition  all that was needed of me was to bring it to a metro store to get it registered  and now i have a perfect iphone   for cheap  i am happy ,5

2252,works great for my daughter  we haven’t tried hooking her up to cell service yet  she has it for texting and facetime  so far works great,5
2253,picked up a phone that would support wi fi calling  this was in as new condition and a very good value,5
2254,this looked brand new out of the box   so far so good,5
2255,i’ve bem using it for   weeks and it looks perfect  the battery will have    of the capacity but i strongly recomend in buying this  i iniciatially bought this to sell the phone in a trade in but i liked it and now i am going to stay with it  i am from brazil and it is working with no problem at all,5

2257,i just got it i love it there had been some bad reviews but it’s been amazing for me,5
2258,dead spots,3
2259,podría venir en caja o al menos con su cargador original  pero es un buen producto,5
2260,phone exactly as described  looks brand new  my phone had   percent maximum battery life so i didnt get too lucky but its exactly as the seller describes ,5
2261,battery life is at    but phone looks brand new  ,4
2262,almost as good as new,4
2263,was somewhat skeptical of buying a  used  phone   when item arrived it was better than described   it looked and performed like new   the accessories that were included were new ,5
2264,exactly as described  i am a repeat buyer from buyspry and i highly recommend as i have been very pleased with the products they provide  phone was in great condition and already had a screen protector installed  thanks for an easy purchase ,5
2265,this iphone was in extremely great condition   and we saved a ton i will always buy my phones from amazon  ,5
2266,the fingerprint reader was a little buggy i kept holding my finger down on the lol screen and somtimes it worked some times it didn t,5
2267,i bought this for my son  he is   and into gaming  streaming  watching movies and videos and he is more than happy with it s performance   especially the storage capacity   phone is as advertised   in like new condition  fully unlocked  we use verizon  and functions as it should  very pleased ,5
2268,personally all my hopes was high but the device just came like device of ebay to be honest i kinda regret purchasing it ,2
2269,was hesitant to get this after reading some negative reviews  purposely waited a couple months to see how it did  seems like a brand new phone  has worked flawlessly ,5
2270,i am so thrilled with this purchase      in much better condition than i expected     will definitely buy from this seller     ,5
2271,don t let the negative reviews sway you  i bought this almost   weeks ago  no issues i didn t even see scratches  it was unlocked fully and like new   i d    recommend ,5
2272,great phone but had to jump through hoops to connect to straight talk,4
2273,i ordered this iphone on   apr     i came back to kenya on   april    like an idiot i thought the seller advertised the product honestly and i could depend on it   since i am in kenya i know they will not honor a warranty   i already had to  replace the battery and the charging port at a cost of        the phone developed an issue and started burning the tips on the charging cables at the rate of one a week and these cost    to    each here   now the screen has started to crack  no i have not dropped it  first the piece at the bottom by the home button came off then it started to peel away around the home button then it cracked on the sides   i am now a believer  i will not purchase a  refurbished  phone again ,1
2274,a mi amigo le gustó mucho,4
2275,the phone was in good condition  the sim card door broke but they sent me a new one  phone seems to be operating fine  would purchase from this seller again when i need to ,5
2276,omg such an upgrade from my    use my phone for work and this just made it so much better  it’s in perfect condition and so much faster ,5
2277,the phone works great  but on the left side of the screen it never goes completely black  there are light streaks on the side of the screen ,3
2278,battery no good  kept cutting off  not clear  i did return it,1
2279,find it funny that their fully unlocked phones are gsm and that they have gsm  unlocked models  too it does everything a phone is supposed to do and trying to get the correct model is horrid,3
2280,like for everything,4
2281,the phone was great i was a little worried because of the reviews but when i received the phone  it was great  the glass at the back is completely intact  there is   small scratches at the front that you can barely even see  the battery life was at    so this was an awesome deal for the money  definitely worth buying,5
2282,i love this product because it is a great phone never gonna sought amazon again ,5
2283,i bought this phone for my daughter  and she loved it  the phone works perfect and the battery lasts  thanks,5
2284,not a good quality not how it looks on pictures or description,1
2285,i haven t been able to use it yet but the phone itself seems to be very nice  however it would have been nice to have some directions with at least the basic instructions with it   i will give you a review as soon as i m able to use it ,5
2286,i had to return   iphones  the first one would not charge  the second one only had    battery charge limit and the speaker on the phone would not work  it was definitely not refurbished  i recommend don t buy a iphone from them ,1
2287,refurbished but not battery,3
2288,i was worried at first after reading some negative reviews but i’m glad i took the risk  the product was amazing  it looks like new and worked like new i would make this purchase again i highly recommend it ,5
2289,not only was i very satisfied with the phone  the customer service was great as well  everyone that i spoke to was very professional  knowledgeable  and polite  great manufacturer ,5
2290,i received the phone and it looks great and very good condition  it also arrived just on time  thank you  i will oorder another iphone from you for my son ,5
2291,this product was for my daughter as a christmas gift but it was in great shape when i gave it to her i m a android user,4
2292,arrived without sim card holder,3
2293,i am really pleased with your shipment speed to get to me your service is just amazing and the phones are just awesome thank you so much,5
2294,i should have exchanged but needed the phone  it looks new  however i can only hear if it’s on speaker ,3
2295,bought for my grand kids they loved it,4
2296,the item works fine but we discovered an annoying scratch right in the middle of the screen and have asked for a replacement   we are awaiting return authorization   authorization has been received and iphone returned   amazon says they will credit my account   you can t ask for much more than that ,5
2297,overall the iphone is in good conditions  however  i need to use headphones or speaker when receiving or making a call  the internal audio is very low ,3
2298,iphone   is an upgrade from my iphone     such a nice phone i d swear it was new   great battery life and with the help of my   year old grandson the migration from my old to the new phone was a breeze   works well with my ford sync and apple watch   highly recommend,5
2299,it was exactly what i was looking for in an iphone replacement,5
2300,product was perfect  all i had to do was get an extended network sim card and i was good to go ,5
2301,ignore all the bad reviews  i got my iphone   gold in the mail this afternoon and it was dent   scratch free  when i went into setting the battery storage is    and the battery life is great it even came with an apple charger   and apple wall box  no dongle though amazing purchase  i’m so glad i bought it ,5
2302,the iphone   was mostly as described  except it is rose gold   not gold  it appears pink  but i have an otter box that hides the color also  i believe this phone originated from another country as i cannot turn down or off the camera shutter sound  not a big deal  but it is extremely loud ,3
2303,phone was fine for the first few months and then the battery life rapidly decreased at the   month mark it would only stay charged for a few hours and now at   months it s dead  won t even turn on  apple advised that it most likely was a defective battery and needs to be refurbished or replaced  total bummer  it died before i get get a backup completed   i now have a sad teenage daughter that won t talk to me anymore   ,2
2304,i absolutely loved this    switched over perfectly with my sim card and have had no problems at all ,5
2305,really happy with this phone  i’ve had it for a little over a month now and it works great ,4
2306,product received was exactly as described  works perfectly  had it   days  had bought an iphone couple years before  refurbished also and am very pleased as it works perfectly ,5
2307,despite it is sold refurbished i attest it came in high quality  the battery  which is always my main concern  lasts almost as new ,5
2308,phone is in like new condition  works great ,5
2309,it is a very nice phone and only like   scratches  very happy ,5
2310,this is a replacement phone for grandaughter  great looking and economical  grandaughter has not had any complaints ,5
2311,the iphone i received was perfect  looked completely new  although used  perfect gift for my daughter  it came with a glass screen protector a non apple charger but no headphones   no big deal ,5
2312,phone came in dead  was expecting that it’s flawless though    battery life  very surprised satisfied,5
2313,this phone is not worth buying  the volume for talking on the phone is horrible  i can barely hear people talking to me  the people on the other end of the line are always telling me they can never hear me  when you get your notifications sometimes the sound is quiet sometimes the sound is super loud  when i close out an app and then turn the phone off and then come back to it later the screen will come up with something that i was doing three weeks ago and have since deleted,2
2314,great product had some issues in the beginning but the straightened it out right away i love my new phone,5
2315,the camera shutter click will not turn off  i’ve tried everything     from what i found this phone must be from japan or korea b c it’s law that the camera sound is always on  so that’s annoying    ,3
2316,liked camara and warenty,4
2317,phone was cute but arrived with a fine crack in the screen despite being well packaged   trademore was slow to get back with me but it looks as if they are going to take care of it now   not thrilled but i mistakes happen and as long as they get it all taken care of  we ll consider using them again ,3
2318,me gusta  me llego a tiempo y fue el regalo  perfecto  para mi hija le encantó,5
2319,perfectly renewed iphone  even came with the original box  a new charger  and sim card removal tools  great product ,5
2320,great price    i received a phone without scratches and excellent conditions  i’m very satisfied with my purchase ,5
2321,el envío fue rápido  el celular llego en perfecto estado  sin ningún detalle y con bateria al   definitivamente volvería a comprar de este proveedor ,5
2322,this phone is only worth the    i paid for it  meaning  you get what you pay for  the speaker for both input and output are horrible  no one can hear me and i can’t hear them  also drops calls repeatedly  will be returning if possible  oh and battery health is only     it seems to be holding a charge fine but    health is pretty bad  amazon needs to do a little more testing before they start sending out these refurbished phones ,2
2323,great deal  the phone arrived very fast and in excellent condition  the listing said “good” condition and that it may have some minor scratches  etc  but it looks brand new  and works very well  it’s about   times faster and has much better battery life than the iphone   that it replaced ,5
2324,i was really excited to order an amazon  premium renewed  iphone  sadly  the first phone was unable to update  and therefore i was not able to restore the backup from my previous phone to it  so i sent it back and amazon sent me a replacement  however  the replacement was a iphone    plus   when i called to ask why they sent the plus sized phone  they told me that the regular size was out of stock   and therefore they gave me a    dollar discount to just keep the wrong sized replacement  i was okay with this  but within a day found out that the microphone on the replacement was dead and i had to yell for anyone to hear me when making calls  i called the  premium renewed  amazon support staff and was told that they had no replacement to offer me as the plus size phone was also out of stock  i sent the second phone back and got a full refund  at the end of the day  buying from  amazon premium renewed  was a big disappointment ,1
2325,came in way earlier than what was initially stated which was a nice surprise no scratches and phone looks great  the charger is not from apple and did not come with headphone adapter overall everything was good ,5
2326,works great  haven’t had any problems setting it up  it’s a great little phone ,5
2327,i was hesitant to purchase a phone before seeing it  but i’m very pleased  the phone appears in great condition and works perfectly  the battery life isn’t perfect but that’s to be expected with a previously used phone  overall great purchase ,5
2328,this phone was in impeccable condition   i was nervous after reading some reviews   but it was in great shape looks new works perfect  ,5
2329,fantastic used iphone    works on verizon without any problems  i was skeptical  highly recommended  be careful because some of the reviews seem to end up on multiple variations of listings  i recommend you double check to make sure the description of the specific phone you order specifies clearly that it will work with your carrier ,5
2330,the video camera shook profusely on phone  something that should have been checked prior to selling  now i have to pay to ship item back because the seller was negligent  i contacted seller and did not receive a response  very disappointing,1
2331,came in and looks brand new   absolutely no problem setting it up   everything works great on it  i would buy again and recommend     ,5
2332,good deal  but the charger was not good,4
2333,i bought this for my daughter and she just loves it  it came in a box with a charger and looks brand new  battery life is excellent and i am really pleased with this purchase  i would definitely buy from this seller again,5
2334,the refurbisher refused to admit they had kept in a fading battery  phone went from    to    in   minutes  their only answer was to return it i finally went to local apple store and had new battery installed for     apple said the battery was indeed degraded  even with that proof  the company refused to reimburse me for battery cost ,1
2335,looks new battery is good,4
2336,renewed phones are a real gamble  i normally have to return       of them before i get one that works  amazon will try to make returns as much of a hassle as possible  so buyer beware this last purchase had a faulty front microphone  it only recorded static an easy test for apple phones is to use  voice memo  app to check the bottom mic  then record a video with the rear camera and check the audio for the back mic  then record a video with the front camera and check the audio of the front mic make sure you also test battery life  fingerprint reader  and accuracy of the touchscreen good luck  hope you get a better phone than the one they sent me ,1
2337,is working very good and is new i love the phone,5
2338,el teléfono presenta un par de rayones en la parte de atrás y a los lados  la batería está bastante defectuosa a sólo el    ,3
2339,the description was accurate as far as cosmetics  but the battery needed a replacement   weeks after purchasing it  it was over heating to the point i couldn’t use the phone ,4
2340,purchased this iphone after reading several reviews   experts touted the iphone   as the best deal for the money around december of     if you re looking for a new phone but don t need the latest  much more expensive model  this is a great choice ,5
2341,this was supposed to be an upgrade over my samsung    the phone runs smooth  the camera and the speakers are a slight upgrade  however  the user interface annoys me   this isn’t my first iphone  the whole bluetooth headphones is a lesser experience and finally the battery  this phone dies in     hours  it’s incredibly inconvenient and a little stressful  i think it’s just the quality the provider sold me  it says in the battery menu that the phone can only hold    of the maximum charge  i am for sure not giving apple another    to change the battery to make it slightly better  once again  who would pay almost    for a phone that dies in     hours  very poor quality  i will gladly keep my old phone and take my money back  update  within the first   hours it randomly turned off and when i turned it back on i had to reboot it to get service back ,1
2342,i have never left a bad review   we own two businesses and i get the impact that reviews could have on a company   it came with a charger and that charger is the only charger the phone worked on   my   year old daughter saved all year for this    iphone     it lasted     months   we went on vacation and she forgot her charger   by the way  it was still in warranty when we left for vacation   her phone would not work with any other iphone charger that we had   i do not know much about the mechanical part of phones other than how to operate them  we went to a technician on vacation thinking it was the battery  battery was fine  charge port was fine   he said the chip was bad on the mother board and to fix it would be significant   the technician said the seller knew this phone had a problem and sold it anyway   amazon contacted seller  seller emailed me it s   weeks out of warranty go to a repair shop   do not buy from this seller   absolutely horrible ,1
2343,phone was in great condition  not a single scratch or mark on the screen or body  battery seems good and the phone functions like it’s new  i’m really glad i decided to give it a try as my old iphone   was starting to go on the fritz and was time for an upgrade ,5
2344,case feels too soft like it will crack easily,3
2345,this item has to be new and not refurbished     easy transfer and super fast delivery  will definitely use again ,5
2346,exactly what i ordered  came faster than i thought too  came with a charger  the correct carrier i wanted    stars ,5
2347,i was a little hesitant ordering a used phone online  but i couldn t be happier with this buy  it came with no flaws scratches and honestly looked unused  it charged to    within an hour too  my daughter is extremely happy with her phone and hasn t put it down since getting it ,5
2348,arrived early  looks brand new  i am happy with my purchase ,5
2349,no face recognition  but this works great  really happy this turned out to be this easy for a new phone,5
2350,was kind of spectacle about buying a renewed iphone    when receiving it  it came in a generic box  iphone looks like new and it will be a great frist phone for my son  would of liked if it came  with an actual apple charger and brick instead of a bootleg one ,5
2351,this is my upgrade from a samsung    omg  the camera is awesome  battery lasts longer   it s super fast  i had to buy an iphone to conform to my provider  virgin mobile   i  didn t want to change providers and lose my number  like my wife did   just can t beat    mo from vm ,5
2352,literally the only reason i was thinking about returning is because i would buy the   plus from the same buyer  there was a tiny scratch on the top left but my case covers it  i love this phone so much    thank you   ,5
2353,subi el volumen al maximo  pero el tono es aún muy bajo  y tambien tiene un punto azún en la panatalla  al lado de auricular  por lo demás  bastante bién ,3
2354,facetime does not work  i have took it to experts on apple phones etc  what really sucks is i still have   payment left to pay  i wish i never purchased it ,3
2355,phone does not hold charge  battery must be bad ,4
2356,nothing about this phone seems used  extremely pleased with the appearance  quality and price  this ‘used’ phone had   the memory at a much lower price than the apple store store  be smart and save your money  the phone came with an apple charger and cube  did not include the headphones but nbd ,5
2357,it looks like new  it s nice  but i understand why it s cheap  because the battery doesn t last long ,3
2358,phone was in good condition and works very well,5
2359,this product was to replace my i phone   stolen until i got the right amount of funds  but have not yet haha so it s working pretty great,5
2360,llego a chile en excelente estado  la batería cumple con una capacidad de    totalmente conforme con el vendedor,5
2361,perfect condition  even battery health is   ,5
2362,much better then i expected  the phone is like brand new  great battery life and no scratches on phone,5
2363,can’t afford the latest and greatest  this phone meets my meager requirements ,5
2364,fingerprint reader is annoying at times other than that it’s a great phone  very good phone for the money ,4
2365,the phone was a complete disappointment  it was in amazing physical condition  no scratches anywhere  but it only worked for about one month before it would just randomly drop into no service mode  battery would overheat and cause the phone to restart multiple times  this phone was a lemon the vendor immediately approved of my return  phone has been returned  i’m waiting to see the credit issued to my account ,2
2366,battery life at    out of box   it was in beautiful condition   couldn’t see a scratch on it   but kept dying on me   i am returning,3
2367,why are they allowed to sell a product that says unlocked when it clearly is locked  so frustrating and a huge waste of time ,1
2368,was super excited to get my new phone  works great no issues and full unlocked just like it said ,5
2369,me encanto la calidad del equipo,5
2370,the problem with this phone was the screen kept getting dark  i called apple  tech service who after troubleshooting said it was a light sensor issue  so back it went  customer service with hybrid it was very good  though  that s why i gave it   stars ,3
2371,estetica y precio bueno pero no tienen buen sonido de parlante,3
2372,no simm card included a downer   but fast ship time  ,4
2373,only one thing it looks like screen is popped out a lil by other than that it’s great,4
2374,using it now  very fast  great storage,5
2375,this is a replacement for an older iphone which could not be updated to support pairing with an apple watch   with the help of a smart granddaughter we were able to set everything up and pair the new watch  i’m happy with the watch and the company that sold it ,5
2376,the speaker is very low barely can hear anything,5
2377,the phone seemed to be unlocked but as i was trying to get to using it it was sudenly locked   they did take the phone back and gave me a full refund but it was a hassle to have to deal with it ,1
2378,so far so good,4
2379,unlike the description on website  it s not like new i understand a bit as it s a renewed product but  even so  i felt not satisfied bcz it s too much damaged however  in the functional perspective and battery quality  it s good to use if i didnt consider the functional quality as the highest priority  i would have returned it already ,3
2380,i have not used this phone since i purchased it a year ago until this past week when my phone broke  i go to my phone carrier after not being able to activate it  there i was told it was not an unlocked phone  really disappointed wish i found out sooner ,1
2381,people are right about the camera    even when you try to silence the camera it still makes noise  even on apps like snapchat  etc  haven’t had any other problems so far tho   update  i returned the phone  it overheats while on the charger if you’re using it at the same time and will keep powering off it untilit cools off  don’t waste your time ,3
2382,it s always a bit of a gamble buying a refurbished iphone  but i have to say  the one i received looks and works like a new one  i haven t found anything on it that doesn t work like it should  needless to say  i m extremely pleased with the purchase ,5
2383,worked   days top jipped out of money,1
2384,i liked the fast shipping and the condition in arrived in  phone looks and works as if it is new  can t beat the   return policy  i highly recommend the company that sold and shipped it ,5
2385,purchased as a  certified renewed premium  product with a guarantee of at least    of original battery capacity  if that is the case  the original battery capacity is pitiful  even without extensive usage  the battery doesn t last   hours ,3
2386,omg i love this phone i’m glad i got this  the battery life is wonderful    i’m gunna buy another phone now ,5
2387,besides it not being in original packaging  got here in one day and great condition from what i can see ,5
2388,muy mala la batería,2
2389,the only problem ive had with this phone is the fact the volume sounds like its way down even when its turned all the way up  ive messed with everything in settings and nothing helped  i have to wear my earphones just to make calls or listen to music  besides that the phone works great and i was able to switch my sim card to it and turn it on ,2
2390,delivered a day early and came as described   the phone i received was in like new condition   i slipped in my sim card and the phone started to work as soon as i turned it back on   i am very pleased with my purchase ,5
2391,i am very satisfied with this purchase great price for   gb i phone    it works very well screen is brilliant all the features work great  today was the third day and battery life was better than my older i phone  need to charge it after   days ,5
2392,the advertise product says the battery health would be over    but when i received the device it has a battery health of   ,3
2393,i am very satisfied with the i phone     it has many more features than was on my previous phone ,5
2394,just got it today  everything looks great so far  working as intended  i will update at a later time if i remember ,4
2395,bought this for my husband for our anniversary  i works great and he loves it ,5
2396,good value  no noticeable damage for a refurbish ,4
2397,i have to recharge my phone daily  otherwise  the phone is fine ,3

2407,overall the phone was a good purchase  can’t give a fair review as i only bought it to trade in for an iphone   ,5
2408,terrible phone  the first time it charged fully my daughter went to school and came home with only    battery and mind you she took it off the charger before school that same morning  also ran very very slow ,1
2409,use it only as phone and text messaging  works good,5

2412,i’m so upset with my purchase  i got this phone for my mom  she lives in ukraine  next day after delivery i sent it overseas  but it doesn’t work  battery is so bad ,1
2413,this phone is renewed so i was a little worried but it works amazing and i have no complaints,5
2414,good phone  some scratches on top right portion  but manageable  only problem is price went down by    immediately after i purchased the phone ,5
2415,sent me two defective phones,1
2416,only    maximum battery capacity  not as guaranteed by the product description on website  i tried to contact seller but didn’t not receive any response ,3
2417,good working so far so good no headphones and stuff like new one but oh well got charger and phone,5
2418,excellent buy  can’t believe that it’s not brand new  everything was new about it  i’ve had it for   months now and still excellent,5
2419,everything was great but the charger cable was no good   amazon couldn’t help me so i had to buy another cable ,4
2420,great refurbished iphone  have no complaints,5
2421,i am fully satisfied with this phone it’s like a new iphone   ,5
2422,this was the best gift i could of gave for christmas as i well for it to be used mines well will say is brand new,5
2423,it’s excellent iphone  ,5
2424,received as promised  i could not find any blemish  bought this for my wife and she is very happy with it  looks and works just like a new phone  i will definitely buy again from this seller when its time for next upgrade ,5
2425,well worth the price   looks brand new  started right up and all my data transferred easily   great product ,5
2426,so far  all is good  set up wand transfer went smoothly and phone is operating well   it was in great shape ,5
2427,screen is almost a micro screen compared to my note   and without a way to expand memory i can see why i stay away from iphones,4
2428,i am having no problems with this phone  i broke mine while moving out of my dorm and bought this one  it arrived in less than   hours  it s a standard iphone   with all the bells and whistles  and really good  seller is trustworthy ,5
2429,good looking  clean and complete phone  everything works and battery life is   got here a day after my daughter s birthday  my fault  should have ordered sooner  but still   days earlier than expected delivery  good phone ,5
2430,i purchased the phone for personal use  it came defective  try using another company or vender  do not buy from this company    they charge too much money and  give a return date knowing that they are unwilling to accept a return or exchange past two months  a phone should last for more than two months   i have been attempting to exchange this phone since february  i only used it for two months  i am still paying for the phone via my amazon charge   i am now stuck with a defective phone with little or no space  defective buttons and a phone that goes off at will   what a waste   ,1
2431,nice quality no visible defects or scratches,5
2432,phone is just like new  zero scratches and performs very well  would buy from again ,5
2433,todo muy bien con este teléfono ni una sala raya  liberado lo traje a panamá  comprare más con este vendedor  rápida entrega ,5
2434,nice iphone it works great ,5
2435,this iphone was in great condition  all i did was turn off my old phone  switch sim cards  turn the new phone on and bam  the iphone did the rest  synced my icloud  upgraded  let me set passwords   within   minutes  my new phone was ready to use  the battery life is perfect  strongly recommend ,5
2436,me encanto   estoy muy contento  gracias amazon,5
2437,the phone was received in excellent condition and we had it activated with no issues  it has been a  positive experience and we are very happy with it ,4
2438,despite all being called  iphone    there are actually several models of iphone   that exist  these are specific for either the gsm or cdma networks  which are two different types of cellular technologies used by the major carriers  sprint  at t  verizon  ect   cdma compatible phones do not work on gsm networks and vice versa  so it s a misnomer to say that any phone which is exclusively gsm or cdma is  fully unlocked   because it will literally be incompatible on a hardware level with about have of the carriers  i was sent the   model of the iphone    at the time of purchase there was no indication of what model was being sold  just  fully unlocked   and this particular model is incompatible with the sprint network  the lack of nuance in the item listing speaks to incompetence in the people who put this item for sale ,1
2439,it came with a bit of scratches but for a renewed phone it s top quality  battery life was at   percent which is pretty good,5
2440,upon receiving this phone it looked new  however using it was a different story  i couldn’t hear on it at all unless i had it on speaker  i thought maybe it had a piece of protector over the ear screen  it didn’t  it also randomly restarts even while on a call   just shuts down  i submitted a request for a replacement  which has now canceled out   even after contacting amazon directly  come to find out the ear screen was absolutely caked with a nasty black substance  probably wax   dirt  so gross   unacceptable  looks like i have to buy another and return this instead of replace it ,1
2441,it had a little scratch in the screen,4
2442,i had an i phone   that over the years lost battery life and home button stopped working  plus i replaced the screen twice  i figured it was time to upgrade  what a mistake  this phone is soooo slow to load any websites  if it ever does    it makes my old phone look good  i should have just replaced the   battery  i guess i should feel lucky  hence two stars rather than one  after reading some of the other reviews in which people bought phones that were totally unusable  it could be worse   ,2
2443,the phone was in very good condition when i received it  only one very minimal scratch on the side which is hardly noticeable  it has been working great ever since i got it  occasionally it has some difficulty reading my fingerprint  but overall i am very happy with this purchase ,5
2444,great budget iphone that still works great  and the renewed iphone   i got was in great condition and even still has applecare warranty from the previous owner i’d say worth it ,5
2445,this phone was like new  it was perfect  no scratches or even fingerprints  i would buy from this vendor anytime  it came to me just like they advertised  great product   it was a great experience working with them,5
2446,i thought it was an off brand but it’s not   and it didn’t disappoint me   i’m actually typing this on the new phone  d,4
2447,the phone looks and functions like new  i was happy to see the battery at    ,5
2448,great phone for my son ,4
2449,pleasantly surprised   few minor cosmetic flaws but not very noticeable   can’t speak to battery health at this point  having only had the device a short time ,4
2450,the red iphone   came just as expected  it had no scratches  no scuff marks  looked brand new  the only difference was that it came in a plain white box  it also came with a charger  which did have the apple logo on the bottom of the plug ,5
2451,what can i say except the phone is great  they are great  much appreciated ,5
2452,the speaker volume is very low,3
2453,received item as describedtransferred data from old device to new device with ease  pleased with purchase as of day   ,5
2454,the phone looks good with minimal wear and tear    for the price am satisfied,5
2455,shipped and received in a timely manner  phone looks brand new and works like new  this was for the purchase of an iphone   ,5
2456,everything works great looks great too  couldn’t be happier got one for my mom too ,5
2457,bought this phone for my   year old daughter  looked to be in great shape  but it s been   weeks and the phone will not charge and can not be turned on  seller claims they will not accept a return if the phone isn t wiped clean and reset  but i can t do that if the phone won t turn on if the seller can contact me and explain how to proceed  i will update my review ,1
2458,my son was down loaded apps battery was already ready at    we decided to return there was also a white light behind screen looked like when they replaced glass they didn’t do it right   buyer beware the return was just awful i am still waiting on my money back bought april     and it’s may     and still no refund awful customer serve and even dealing with amazon service for return is horrible and i do not do a lot of returns this was my first return of anything  very poor service all around with seller and amazon,1
2459,i bought this phone for my brothers birthday and from reading the reviews i wasn’t to sure about it but when it got here it was great  it looks new didn’t have any scratches and it come with a changer  the only thing is that it didn’t come with headphones but it’s okay ,5
2460,excellent smartphone  i did not have any idea how this iphone works or if the seller was serious and legit   i have to say that i love my iphone especially the price  my iphone was delivered on time  under all the specifications the seller gave for this iphone  it meets my expectations ,5
2461,el cargador no servia,3
2462,the alien case was to big so was the scene cover but the rest of my order was great thank you,5
2463,phone looks and works as though it was new  i wish they would give a tiny bit of history behind these phones but if i had to guess this couldn t have been owned very long  maybe previously open box or return item  it came with a screen protector placed perfectly  bonus ,5
2464,i returned this apple    i charged it to the full battery  i started to set it up with the internet  and started to go round and around endlessly  i couldn’t pass through the settings   i returned ,3
2465,a major upgrade from my iphone   which died after many years of use  i use a phone to talk to people  text   and play solitaire so i didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new model so this was perfect ,5
2466,excellent phone  got one that didn t work was able to send it back with no hassle and got another ordered  the phone is in great condition and is working well   definitely reccomend ,5
2467,this came with a cracked camera  not what i was expecting  even referbished ,3
2468,acts like a new phone  very user friendly  love the size   happy with battery life  ,5
2469,we ordered two  renewed  phones from refoned vendor  one for me and one for my daughter  my daughter activated hers right away  it worked for about two months  then failed  i called the vendor  and since it was within the three month warranty window  the phone was returned for a refund  since i had not activated my phone yet  i let her use my renewed phone  it failed after about a month  but just beyond the three month warranty date  i contacted the vendor again  and they refused to work with me to fix  replace  or refund the phone  simply stating it had passed the warranty  the phone only worked for about one month  i would not order from this vendor  refoned ,1
2470,this is the first iphone i’ve ever had  i’ve always had android so i’m not super familiar with the os and capabilities  i do like it and if i didn’t know it was used i wouldn’t think it was used  it looks brand new ,5
2471,love it  smaller iphone for a decent price  but it’s for my kid and he is   ,5
2472,si    me encantó,4
2473,i bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and i try to contact the company but no response  i contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back   i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back  i was waiting a day because i wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one  i would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money  i contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return  suggesting i take it to a  repair shop  and have them look at it  it freezes constantly and the volume doesn t work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute  i m very disappointed in the whole situation ,1
2474,                    the media could not be loaded                  this is worth the money very clean and nice phone let’s see how long it will hold up for purchase last week wednesday,5
2475,arrived before the date  well packaged with no imperfections   all works well and i am very happy with this purchase  saved a lot of money  ,5
2476,the equipment was unlocked and worked perfectly with t mobile buy and send super fast and well packaged  this seller is recommended,5
2477,i’ve had this phone now for over   months and have used it while on overseas  travel  usa and europe   at the gym  for every need possible  and also hooking up external devices  bluetooth  usb  and had experienced nothing but absolute happiness and very thankful   highly recommend this product and seller  thank you again ,5
2478,it came early the batter is fair could be better but overall is a big upgrade from a android almost like new,5
2479,i really enjoy the iphone  the ux is soooo much better than the android phone it replaced  phone itself is in excellent condition  pretty much indistinguishable from brand new  essentially i got a loaded iphone   for half price  thanks ,5
2480,i was nervous to buy it because it was so cheap but it works so well,5
2481,this phone is dead after   months  sent the report to amazon but no response beware of amazon refurbished mobile first   months it was good ,1
2482,the phone seemed well at first  all outside conditions were great other than minor scratches  but the phone would sometimes shut down as if dead when could be at high charge  when it would power back on it would say it was completely dead and would only let me be on it for a few minutes before restarting the pattern  phone wouldn t charge during these moments so there was literally nothing i can do  and sometimes when the phone would do this is would go right back to its normal charge and work as normal until the sequence started back up  this was extremely annoying when i would be busy on my phone  one morning i woke up and the phone would not power on at all  even when tried charging with multiple chargers  i sent it to apple thinking this was a simple battery problem and i could pay a cheap    for a replacement but later got a message saying that the phone was completely defected an the problem was far beyond just the need of a battery replacement  refunding immediately ,1
2483,i really like the product  it was in good condition  battery life     fingerprint reader is excellent ,5
2484,this phone was exactly what it says it is  it has worked perfect for my young teen ,5
2485,super fast delivery ordered on wednesday received phone on thursday  iphone   with minor wear to the device  fully operational battery  fully functional phone  extremely satisfied with the phone provided ,5
2486,la batería no tiene duración de carga  la huella no funciona correctamente y el reconocimiento facial no lo he encontrado,3
2487,great value for the money  works fine  it needed a new battery but that was the only problem,5
2488,wow this is a solid deal phone is clean no cracks or noticeable scratches and the battery health is perfect ,5
2489,great replacement for my lost phone   however i found my phone and was able to return   great service ,5
2490,on the box that i got it said new so idk if it’s really new but it came in perfect shape  like it actually was brand new   overall the phone is great and the battery percentage thingy it said that it was     i love my phone and i do recommend,5
2491,it took me a while to actually write a review on this because i wanted to be sure about the battery life and use it for a while  i’m usually  skeptical about refurbished products because something is usually wrong with it  but this phone works like brand new  i’m glad i didn’t regret this  ,5
2492,dependable seller  item was as represented ,5
2493,it’s what i ordered really  i’m just mad the battery life was at   when i got it ,3
2494,great phone  the only issue i had was that the phone was incompatible to boostmobile which i was tired of this company anyhow and was ready to switch to another carrier  works great with t mobile though,5
2495,so far the phone has performed very well as expected from an apple product  perhaps it’s too early to evaluate the battery issue we are happy with this product ,5
2496,shipping takes a long time no face recognition  ,4
2497,the charger is a random black cube that isn’t fit the phone  also it didn’t even come with the headphones ,3
2498,i’m not even sure this was a real iphone  it doesn’t do the stuff it should  i couldn’t even download apps from appstore  i requested return after having phone on for   mins  it’s a piece of crap  so not only are u over paying for a crap phone  you will have a hard time getting a refund  it’s been a week since i returned and i can’t even track my package  u will have to wait   whole weeks to get any money back  so if you are needing a phone like i did  do yourself a favor and order elsewhere  buying this ruined amazon for me period  i’ll go to the store from now on to buy anything of value  lesson learned ,1
2499,great storage  battery doesn’t last long  can’t use the phone unless you put it on the speaker  can’t hear it otherwise ,3
2500,i m extremely pleased with the phone  it has a few user scratches on the top of the phone  but nothing    battery health can t cure    it actually exceeded my expectations i don t know about the other sellers  but i d definitely buy from hybrid it again ,5
2501,charged battery wont last for more that   hours,1
2502,got it for my mom  she loves it…,5
2503,i had a couple of other iphones where i really noticed the battery either having a very short working life or actually swelling and pushing out the front face of the phone  i can safely say that i am happy not to have noticed if this phone s battery life is just  good enough  or actually  great  ,5
2504,phone was brand new and so simple to use it’s perfect and the customer service is amazing,5
2505,when we ordered this phone we were concerned as some of the reviews were not great  our daughter wanted this specific phone for her birthday  so we held our breath and ordered  it s been a great phone for her   i have recommended several friends to order as well ,5
2506,ordered   to give away for x mas   out of   had batteries that would not hold a charge  will not buy from here again,5
2507,i’m returning back to iphones once again and this is the perfect one to start with  yes the battery after i charge it in the morning it stays charged all daymy calls are clear my music is too i love the pics too  great ph,5
2508,i have had the device now for over   months and it came in tiptop condition  customer service was great in resolving my delivery signature issue and device was as if brand new ,5
2509,well the iphone was in great condition but the battery had to be replace   the apple store   cost me        ,3
2510,i just got this phone not to long ago the battery only last for about   hours and i dropped my phone one time with a case on the phone now it won t turn on when i try to charge it and they claim there warranty don t cover that,1

2527,received this phone for over a month and the only problem i’ve had is sometimes the lte won’t go through  but i just restart the phone and it works   pretty sure it’s an apple thing  i’m using with straight talk and it works fine,5

2554,the phone doings good i got it thursday i’m actually texting this review on the phone right now,5
2555,i phone   is ok for a old model,3
2556,hey guys i just want to say thank your the phone my boyfriend loved it but the small issue is that i thought i had bought the   instead of the regular   because i had typed it in   anyhow the phone is working great the charger works well it charges really fast and it’s just amazing ,5
2557,uniqueme sold us a phone that works so well  that you would never know it was used  and you get to pick a free new accessory for your  new  phone too ,5
2558,i’m loving my iphone  i love the fingerprint reader and easy to use ,5
2559,bought two iphones from these guys  i m barely past the warranty period and one of the iphones consistently shuts off when it gets a little warm  we only noticed recently because the person i gifted the phone to didn t start using it until one month ago  it took a month to really notice the problem  i called and explained the situation to these guys  and they couldn t get me off the phone fast enough  since we were out of warranty  they just said  nope  no exceptions   i understand that technically they don t have to work with us to solve the problem  but seriously  in this day and age  great companies who care about customer service will be reasonable and help find a solution  i m even willing to pay a little for them to swap out phones  but they were completely dismissive and rude to me on the phone and    unwilling to help  i d recommend taking your chances buying a phone with another company  if you ever run into any problem  these guys clearly have zero interest in doing the right thing  very disappointing ,1
2560,the charger socket doesn t work  only it works with the fake charger port which comes with the package ,3
2561,the phone was bought for my son   works great,5
2562,very nice phone  looks brand new  works great  very satisfied  very reliable company  i had my phone in a couple days  i will deal with them again ,5

2565,muy buenas condiciones,4
2566,price  delivery exceed expectations ,5
2567,we bought this phone for our daughter and she was happy with it after   months she started complaining about the phone because the fingerprint reader stoped working and every time she turned it completely off and on back again it won t turn on and the whole screen turns black,2
2568,buenas tardes  el teléfono está bien pero me vendieron con   gb de almacenamiento y en verdad tiene   ,4
2569,the phone i loved what i did not like is that it came without so much protection and was also turned on for now it is working well,4
2570,i would definitely buy it again,5
2571,so far so good but no sim card kit included  unless i’m missing something it’s not in the description ,4
2572,works great  ,5
2573,i’ve personally purchased   different phones from amazon over the last   years and have never had any problems with any of them  they always arrive in great condition and have worked like new to this day  and  this purchase follows suit  perfect condition and works great ,5
2574,great iphone   thank you,5
2575,battery needed to be replace  wouldnt hold a charge  that’s my only complaint,3
2576,me llego estado nuevo  funciona todo y lo estético está      no le doy   estrellas porque me hubiera gustado que venga con los accesorios originales ,4
2577,really good phone for my youngest for her to use as a tablet for road trip or something,5
2578,the phone arrived as expected and looked good   battery was at    health as was advertised online   however  be aware that    must be the service cut off for apple   when we checked the battery health in settings  it reports that the batter needs to be serviced   as a comparison    i have another iphone   with battery health at    and the iphone   that we were replacing has batter health of      i was not expecting to have to pay another    dollars to replace the battery on this phone update   we also found out a few days after we received the phone that the front facing camera does not work at this point  i would not recommend this seller to anyone   their quality control is not very good ,1
2579,highly recommend this seller  we have always gotten quality products from them for a great price ,5
2580,no issues  just changed sim card from old phone to new  works greatrefurbished  great price ,5
2581,did not receive a charging chord,3
2582,i’ve personally purchased   different phones from amazon over the last   years and have never had any problems with any of them  they always arrive in great condition and have worked like new to this day  and  this purchase follows suit  perfect condition and works great ,5
2583,i m very please with this product i must say the only inconvenient was the battery of the cell phone which is    so far,4
2584,battery used          ,3
2585,in very good condition and it came with a phone charger,5
2586,this is my first time buying a refurbished phone  which greatly exceeds my expectations for a second hand phone  it is indeed as good as the new one  it can be used for one day on a single charge  in addition  it is indeed very cheap and cost effective ,5
2587,very satisfied  light scratches but i expected that  touch screen isn’t as sensitive but it’s a great product for the price,4
2588,everything was perfect even came two days early  no scratches or any signs of use either  after reading some bad reviews i was slightly worried but figured i could always return it if it’s not what i expected  but i couldn’t of asked for better results ,5
2589,phone arrived and it was everything i d expect from an iphone    with one critical exception  it was   a  the main difference this makes on a day to day basis for anyone buying this is that the camera sound is hardwired on due to japanese law  so  caveat emptor  you may be stuck with the annoying camera sound ,3
2590,as advertised  looks like new  not a scratch on it  very fast delivery ,5
2591,came in good condition for a renewed phone  i was happy with this purchase at a great price ,5
2592,this refurbished phone is awesome  it’s at the right price and no scratches  practically new ,5
2593,battery life is decent  my power button was sticky,3
2594,the battery life was kinda bad but other than that i enjoyed that phone for about a year ,3
2595,phone works like new  literally ,5
2596,even though this is renewed by amazon  but we would expect refurbished into good condission    thing open the package  notice there big wear scatch over left hand panel  the silent switch seems to be weared  checked battery level health only    at max  very concerned for battery life  the phone charger looks very cheap from third party  can be dangerous when using to charge the phone  have to buy another charger or oem apple charger instead ,1
2597,it a good iphone starter,4
2598,iphone was exactly what i wanted  great condition  great price  works great  love it  even arrived earlier than expected ,5
2599,doesn t come with oem charger which is not stated  not worth it to return though as phone is good  seller should specify about the charger though ,4
2600,i like the reliability of the apple cell phone   the fingerprint reader is a time saver and is safer than passwords  battery life so for good,5
2601,great starter phone for my sons   birthdayeverything works as if it was brand new  the battery life is great and the touch id works too ,5
2602,had to return the phone  it did not charge after the first day and completely went dead  would not turn on  such a hassle  and returning it is a task in itself  ,1
2603,iphone entry does not recognize headset  i bought another original headset and tried everything and unfortunately the input doesn t recognize the phone ,5
2604,it s been a few weeks and i am happy with this product   i received it withing     days and it has worked quite well so far   i will consider this seller and product again in the future ,5
2605,phone has average battery life and price was about average   phone was in good working order when received  however needed to replace screen recently  no visible damage was present but display stopped working  not sure if there was warranty on this purchase but couldn t needed to have repaired quickly so i didn t have time to find out ,3
2606,missing the memory holder   we had to buy it in mexico   it was a gift,3
2607,my   year old is in love with it  great choice and no one can tell it’s refurbished,5
2608,this turned out to be rose gold  not gold  otherwise  it is a normal working and looking iphone  as expected ,4
2609,the cell phone in very good condition  the price also good  cell phone work perfectly,4
2610,really great phone,4
2611,the phone is very pretty  so i put it in a clear case  all my iphone   data transferred over perfectly and i enjoy all the upgraded features  the fingerprint reader worked well for a couple of weeks  but doesn’t any more  the price was right ,5
2612,phone arrived on time and was exactly as described ,5
2613,i loved the phone when i received it  it looked brand new  sadly  the phone has already died  i suspect it’s the battery that can’t hold a charge  but not sure  ,2
2614,phone is in excellent cosmetic condition with three exceptions     the home button is recessed below the surface of the face plate and it isn t centered  it works but has a much different feel from my other iphone     there is a large dark spot on the top right of the screen    the battery life is    which is my reason for getting a different iphone   the description stated renewed  new   i suspect the screen has been replaced as well  i will be returning the phone tomorrow  ,2
2615,it is absolutely available with japanese biglobe sim however  a wifi channel channel of aterm   cannot connect for some reason that i do not figure out ,4
2616,this iphone   replaces my iphone five very good updates and the iphone   in comparison to the iphone  ,4
2617,this happens to be a great phone,5
2618,battery health was around     probably have to buy another one in a few months   ,3
2619,the phone was turning off by itself only a couple of weeks after use    months later it wont stay on and boot loops making the phone unusable  unless it is on a charger constantly  beware ,2
2620,the iphone   arrived within two days  phone looks great like it’s brand new  it’s rose gold color  received the phone yesterday and got wireless service for it today with at t  nothing bad to say  there are many negative reviews on refurbished phones  but just do your homework and research before purchasing ,5
2621,i purchased as an upgrade for my mom   it s january   and she s still using it   it works perfectly ,5
2622,in great condition,5
2623,yes,4
2624,i’m always nervous about buying phones  the reviews on this one looked good sooooo i went for it and was not disappointed the phone is great  looks like a new phone i’ve had it for a couple months and it’s been great ,5
2625,brought it down to at t and they set me up with a number and a sim card  but the service once set up would drop in and out  no service   the at t rep  told me to charge it completely and download the latest software to see if that helps  well it didn t   to expedite the process of return and reorder i accepted an immediate replacement of the same phone  i m waiting on it  can t happen twice  i hope received a replacement iphone about a week or so ago  and so far it is working like a champ  hopefully  it will last a while  so far i d give the replacement a   ,1
2626,its been a month since i bought it  so far it still works great  no screen cracks,5
2627,obviously this is rare but mine came with a broken autofocus causing the camera to shake violently  clearly this wont happen with everyone who buys  but if quality control cant pick up an issue that major then thats a problem,1
2628,i am happy  it is refurbished and the price was fair ,5
2629,bought for my granddaughter and as she is hard on phones i purchased case and protector plus sim card  case protector and sim were easy to install and the phone works great ,5
2630,my teen son likes the phone and has no problems with it  it s a good value for the money ,3
2631,this is just as described like brand new  you can not find another phone at this price in as good of condition  i was able to place my sim and set up was as easy as        very fast shipping  would highly recommend  amazing product and price  ,5
2632,,5
2633,i bought an iphone   silver  but arrived a white one  i live in argentina and is so dificult to return the phone  the phone works great but the saler need to pay more atention beafore send the item  thanks,3
2634,it had a problem  sounds  voice  of incoming calls were not clear and suficently loud ,3
2635,this phone is like brand new  totally unlocked  i absolutely love it  and i had it in   days ,5
2636,internal speaker quit working after a week,2
2637,my granddaughter love it,5
2638,a good brand,5
2639,locked,1
2640,my son loves his phone ,5
2641,everything is good about the phone  came earlier than expected  there’s two scratches on the screen  but i’ll live   works great  ,4
2642,pretty much like new  i was quite skeptical given its amazon and one step removed from the wild west but the device is just about like new  a strong battery  no scratches  everything functions well and it even came with a tempered glass screen protector  i’m very impressed with the renewed program ,5
2643,i ordered this phone to get a heavy discount off of the new iphone   i’m trying to buy  apple would not accept it due to a small nick in the upper corner of the screen  now i need to return this and order a new one to get my discount,3
2644,arrived on time  the phone looked brand new  the battery capacity was at    which is good for a refurbished  have had no issues with this phone  would recommend this seller ,5
2645,in around   months of purchase  i see the maximum capacity of the battery only    and the battery health status shows that it needs service  watch out for any defective items you may receive ,1
2646,we absolutely love the product  it s a refurbished phone but it looks and work s like a brand new phone,5
2647,best refurbish phone  every features of the phone works well  fully unlocked phone  no problems so far ,5
2648,everything worked as described  phone was great quality for being a used product ,5
2649,first one went haywire   sent it backwe haven t had the second long enough to make a clear call ,3
2650,learning to use  so different from my old android ,5
2651,description  renewed  was very accurate  good seller ,5
2652,for it being an   it was in perfect condition and plenty of storage ,5
2653,no comment,5
2654,i went to a verizon store and low and behold they said that yes it is unlocked  but this model will only work with t mobile and at t  had i known that i wouldn t have made the purchase  but i had to go with at t because i needed a phone right there and then  its true it is unlocked  but the seller should have been more truthful and said that it is not compatible with many other carriers  so in essence it is semi unlocked ,2
2655,i had an crack on my home button other then that i love it,4
2656,i’ve had this phone for just over two weeks now  and i haven’t had any issues with it     knock on wood      my carrier is t mobile  so connecting to the network was as simple as transferring my sim card from my dinosaur   to this phone  i feel like i got what i paid for  and i am satisfied with my purchase ,5
2657,i really like my  new  apple phone  the gold color is beautiful but the phone itself is really nice with a lot better features than my old    i can finally have more apps on it with the bigger storage  and yay for better pictures ,5
2658,i like it so far  i can use my phone with verizon ,4
2659,i didn t even get to use the product  the day it arrived i opened it as you can see the screen was popping out of the base  i didn t want to even connect the charger it could of been a bad battery wasn t going to have something explode on my hand  so i restored it in its same packaging and called the company  they had the worst response ever  do you know you bought a refurbished phone  so that s a good enough answer to why the phone looks like it s about to pop in your hand never buying anything from   refone    ever i ve bought phones refurbished two years ago and still working properly till this day   refone  get your stuff together your product trash,1
2660,my   refurbished iphone    gold  came on time exactly as listed  amazing condition  not a scratch  totally functional so happy about it and excited ,5
2661,i bought this for my daughter for her birthday but didn t want to spend close to       this phone works great  came packaged well  no headphones but we bought   we have metro pcs and the hook up was fine and has worked great   love it ,5
2662,the phone is cool  finger print is precise but no facial recognition  the battery life is ok ,5
2663,excellent phone like new  everything work well,5
2664,item color description is gold but arrived rose gold,3
2665,only draw back the headphones on this phone are the charging port    this didn’t come with the adapter to fit beats     had to buy separate   also i don’t like that it comes with a generic cord    they charge slowly    but great for my middle school child ,5
2666,iphone was a verizon refurbished phone  worried at first it would not be compatible with consumer cellular  works off at t  but i ve had no issues and the phone was in mint condition   came with charging cord and plug plus tool to access sim card ,5
2667,i love the iphone   itself  i got one on release  this one was meant to replace a larger screen phone that i couldn’t get used to   but unfortunately this “renewed” phone wasn’t up to par  the description says minimal to no visible wear  however  the inch long gouge smack in the middle of the screen says otherwise  there are tons of micro scratches all over the screen visible when held at an angle to light  but the gouge is way too distracting and obvious all the time  screen on or off  even looking straight on  so unfortunately i had to return it  i should have known the price was too good to be true ,2
2668,i purchased this refurbished phone       for        prior to purchasing the phone  i  asked about the battery life   now  the battery is dead as of        less than   months after purchase   usage cost me      month average based on purchase price   i could have had a current brand new  iphone for that monthly usage cost   do not use this vendor   they should have replaced the battery as a good will gesture even if past warranty date   as a business owner  that is how i would have taken care of a customer to earn future business from them   shame on electronic deals reply from  vendor hi brigitte  we are very sorry to hear this  unfortunately  the order is past   days old and the warranty period has expired  we suggest taking the device in to apple or a local authorized apple technician for repair we sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused kind regards electronic deals family   staff,1
2669,got this phone for my mom  fast shipping and phone in very good condition  everything good so far ,5
2670,phone was delivered by fedex  excellent condition   had screen protector on it already  no scratches and just like new  great deal and i’m very happy with purchase  took sim card out of iphone   and put right in the new iphone   and all is working great  everything as advertised ,5
2671,the product was delivered quickly and i was not disappointed  the phone battery lasts for more than one day withouut charging everything works well  great product ,5
2672,luego de   mes de uso el cable dejó de funcionar y el celular carga sólo hasta   ,3
2673,everything worked on the phone and it was perfect condition  i have no complaints  i m very satisfied,5
2674,battery life is terrible constant problems with the phone,3
2675,minor mark on the back of the phone but as far as the phones performance so far so good,5
2676,overall the phone was great physically  he battery was    upon arrival and stated  service    my dad was still super happy with it  no biggie i ve changed many iphone batteries in the past  everything else is    great and functional ,5
2677,it doesn’t stay charged the battery on the phone is damaged because battery life is like two to three hours actually on the screen time before it’s ready to be charged takes forever charging it,2
2678,the cell phone works fine but it drops calls left and right all the time  it has nothing to do w my cell phone provider because my other cell phone doesn’t drop calls  i use this as a secondary business line and i hate that it drops calls ,2
2679,battery was down to     fingerprint scanner is hit and miss still a good value ,5
2680,i highly recommend like brand new,5
2681,great condition  like new  just that the generic charger didn t worked  but other than that great buy  ,4
2682,it arrived pretty quickly  great deal  my son is happy ,5
2683,we purchased two of these phones  one arrived with an lcd bleed  which at least allowed us to see the problem early enough to send it back in time for a refund  please note that the problem was clearly visible as soon as the phone was turned on  it should have never been resold this way  the second phone would occasionally not connect to cellular data  a problem that got worse over time until it eventually stopped making and receiving calls altogether i cannot stress enough the frustration you will likely feel at buying a  refurbished  phone that has seemingly not undergone any refurbishing  i m sure others have had better luck of the draw  but there doesn t seem to be any quality control on what s being sent out  it is a waste of money and time  and you are better off not purchasing here ,1
2684,nice phone works perfect and with working will rarely has scratches and work super soft,5
2685,i bought this iphone for my birthday  i was very skeptical of buying a renewed phone  but it came in basically brand new and everything working well  it came in one day earlier than the expected time and so far everything is great  really pleased with this purchase ,5
2686,company is easy to work with  phone is in great condition  would definitely purchase from them again ,5
2687,everything was exactly as i expected  no issues so far  no problem swapping it ,5
2688,i’m happy with the phone i ordered  however  the phone is actually rose gold not gold as the description states ,4
2689,el celular se encuentra en perfectas condiciones  llegó con batería al      lo adquirí para mi hijo de   años y está encantado  hasta ahorita funciona bien ,5
2690,i was very skeptical about purchasing this phone online because i’ve read a few customer reviews  however this phone was my best investment by far and i saved over     great condition and no scratches     ,5
2691,like it    lezzzzz gooooo       ,5
2692,great purchase so far had over a year for a child,5
2693,i got this for my wife  we have always had android phones  so the setup and apps are way different  the screen size was the real issue i returned the phone ,3
2694,this is the best thing i’ve ever bought  after reading the reviews i was nervous to buy it but when my phone arrived it was practically brand new other than missing the iphone box  i love it  i got the silver and it is in perfect condition ,5
2695,the phone itself works fine but not once has my battery ever died on     in fact it hasn’t gotten to    once since i’ve bought it  so without that annoying detail it’s fine ,3
2696,just like picture and runs as if brand new  would never guess it wasn’t   love it   now even a year later,5
2697,this product looked brand new  arrived timely  excellent customer service  i will always look for the ”kanga” supply company when ordering electronics ,5
2698,phone arrived and works  but the battery health is     unacceptable  now you re asking the customer to take apart their phone either now or in the next month or so to replace something that should have been taken care of  you re assuming the customers have odd screw drivers like tri wings  you re assuming the customer can replace the waterproofing measures on this phone just to replace a battery  from now on  you do it  not okay ,2
2699,have only had this renewed unit but seems to be working great only time will tell ,5
2700,iphone was unlock i was able to connect to my service provider  looks new great condition,5
2701,functional and much cheaper than new,5
2702,excellent condition,5
2703,i thought this would be a renewed phone  as in  any issues from previous use would be fixed before it was sold to me  nope  screen has noticeable imperfections  battery is at    capacity  speaker crackles when playing music  and people say it sounds like i’m standing next to a waterfall when i call them  so the best i can say is that it is a functioning  if poorly  iphone  the seller offers a refund  but i will have to buy another phone to use before i can send this one back ,2
2704,very nice conditions,5
2705,the phone works great besides the battery slightly degraded was used which is to be expected great condition,5
2706,the phone stopped working after a week  i was out with a group of my friends  we were out of state and the phone stoped working  i don’t know why  i took it to someone to fix it and everything  so i don’t recommend ,1
2707,tiene una marca en una esquina  presumiblemente de un golpe  pero el te  funciona bien ,4
2708,nothing wrong with my product  came before i knew it and it’s in perfect condition ,5
2709,great phone for price no problems yet,4
2710,upgrade from iphone    reasonably priced  works a    better than the old phone,4
2711,fast delivery and quality product  i recommend everyone ,5
2712,phone looked like new,5
2713,i would not recommend anyone buying from this company  second phone from the same company and neither one worked ,1
2714,i was excited to get my son a nice  affordable iphone to use for texting and playing some games  the product description on amazon says the the battery health of their refurbished iphones exceed     but this one came with just    and a ‚service‘ notification in the battery settings  i have to return it,2
2715,as described,5
2716,works fine,5
2717,the phone  works good i love it,5
2718,i bought this phone as a an upgrade to my    and i couldnt be happier  the device came in great condition and works perfectly ,5
2719,received my phone and proceeded to verizon for a new chip and phone number  after a few days i could call out but i most calls the other end was unable to hear me  mostly crackling sound  had verizon look at the phone and they saw no issues with it  i returned the phone to the third party seller  they charged me a    restocking fee for a defective item  never going to purchase anything from this seller again ,1
2720,battery life is in     when i got it  home button feels funny  times,3
2721,the device seems like newall options and software is working wellbut there is one of two speakers is not working  i think this is a very important info which shouldn’t be hidden for the customerif i knew that the speaker is not workingi wouldn t buy the devicemaher yacoub,3
2722,it gets pretty hot when the hotspot is being used while charging but other than that it work great  had it for about a month now ,4
2723,works like new and no cosmetic flaws  had no issues with activation  came with charger  screen protector and sim tool  happy with this purchase,5
2724,i liked paying cash for my phone rather than paying the phone company in increments   much savings   the  refurbished  phone looks like and works as if new   i believe it probably was new  just a return from someone else   advantageous for me ,5
2725,battery charge is not as long as it should be  icloud storage seems to be limited ,5
2726,thank you so much for a quality product for good value  my original phone died during this pandemic and it is crucial to have some way to stay in touch during this time  you saved my world ,5
2727,you can buy this phone if your on a budget because its pretty nice for the price ,4
2728,i purchased this phone in july   and already in sep   the battery is going bad   if it was guaranteed at    it wasn t   i left it on the charger last night and it was dead in the morning   and no    no power outage   i don t recommend this dealer ,1
2729,even though the phone came without the sim card holder  the seller quickly responded to my concern and the missing piece is on its way to me  thanks for the attention,5
2730,needed another phone fast to replace my other one  i love it  it gets the job did ,5
2731,my old phone was slow this is easy to use and similar applications   all i had to do was switch sim card,5
2732,i liked this product  noting wrong with the cell phone would order one again if i had too ,5
2733,the phone works great except for the battery   i realize the battery health is at least     but the battery does not function like a new product   it definitely dies down way faster than it should   product is great but the battery isn t ,3
2734,the refurbished iphone is pretty good and all the accessories are also good  the battery and the screen all seem well  in addition  i also use a software on my laptop to check the product and the result also shows this one is a good one ,5
2735,good,5
2736,phone works fine  but the charging cord stopped working after   days and the usb end wouldn t even fit into the adapter that was sent with it  battery last about half a day  to spend so much money on a product  you d think the accessories would at least be up to par ,3
2737,like new       battery life  not a single scratch    in my experience  fully recommended ,5
2738,surprised to have a charger and screen protector,5
2739,amazing phone  it came really fast and i’m really satisfied with the condition and battery life on the phone  i would order from you again in the future  ,5
2740,condition of the phone was as described except for the battery life  runs down too quickly   product arrived a week late ,3
2741,it has pretty good battery for an iphone    cosmetically looks great  works well ,5
2742,seemed like a great deal  battery life was only around    but we just dealt with that  then   months outside of amazons   day warranty period the phone just dies and will not charge anymore  now the phone only works for   minutes unless connected to a charging cable  which makes it useless without a new battery  obvious battery issue  i should have requested a replacement when i noticed the lower than expected battery life ,2
2743,my iphone arrived and it is a beauty    took it to at t to get it activated  they just swapped the sim cards between my old   and the new phone  presto  with a bit of standard formatting  i m up and running  i love this phone ,5
2744,excellent condition  thank you so much  love it ,5
2745,i was hesitant to order from amazon  worried that it would be a bad quality phone or have damages  i m glad to say that it works wonderfully  i love my phone    no scratches  in mint condition  battery level is    ,5
2746,phone is in great condition  no issues getting it activated  arrived a day head of schedule ,5
2747,el celular en excelente estado  como nuevo  me encanto super rápido ,5
2748,the packaging was great and the phone itself is in good working order and condition at this time   so far so good  ,5
2749,i was delivered a box with a charge cable and an ac adapter   it was picked up at a ups store untampered   i sent back what i received and accused of attempt to fraud   i m out    ,1
2750,everything works just fine ,5
2751,i thought this was a good buy but quickly found it had flaws   the first thing i had trouble with was it didn’t recognize my fingerprint even though i registered it several times   the same touch button was difficult to work   i had to touch several times to get it to work   finally  in the middle of a conversation  my party could not hear me but i could hear them fine   it was like i muted it but it was not   at this point my   day warranty had expired two weeks ago at     i could have bought a new one with monthly payments and a longer warranty ,1
2752,brought this for my father for his birthday and he absolutely loves it  great product ,5
2753,it s better than my expectation  the phone look nice  camera working  it fits my hand properly ,5
2754,i brought the wrong item but i don t find it very easy to find the return information,4
2755,this is my first iphone and so far  i love it  i cannot imagine paying full price for a brand new iphone when a refurbished one is so much more affordable  the phone i ordered came quickly and works perfectly   would highly recommend ,5
2756,who needs a brand new phone  not me  this phone was like new and the price was right  works and looks perfect ,5
2757,economical iphone upgrade for those who don t want to spend lot money upgrading to newer ones ,5
2758,it was as described,5
2759,battery life to short  touch screen fine  i am face recognition  will happen to check that out ,3
2760,really like this item  product was in perfect condition  my daughter loves it  she is   ,5
2761,i will definitely buy again from this site   the  i phone   was exactly what it says on the description    perfectly new   never been used and the most important feature is completely unlocked to  use abroad   thank you for delivering a great product ,5
2762,the phone looks brand new and works great  i am very pleased,5
2763,no instructions  can hardly hear people  had to have expert fix simple prolems,3
2764,thank you,5
2765,i was skeptical if to purchase this phone after seeing some mixed reviews but i did and it was perfect  works like brand new and came with a tempered glass on  i’ve had it for   months now with no complaints   great value for money ,5
2766,as a gift  and no complaint or dislike comment as at now  i think i d good phone ,5
2767,it was like new and for the   dollars that i paid it was really a good deal please be sure that if you order some it be shipped by amazon  its the best way to do it,5
2768,works  and look like new… good deal   excellent iphone,5
2769,i will admit that i was a little skeptical about buying a iphone from amazon  but it was the best decision i could have made  i was very impressed with the “newness” of the phone  everything works perfectly and they also threw in a free tempered glass ,5
2770,i have a week of using it and there’re no complains  i do recommend it if you want to save some money and have a good phone only complain is that   week after i receive it  the price dropped a lot ,5
2771,good product  but the battery is not as strong as desired since it is a used phone ,4
2772,battery should have been replaced and priced in     to save a penny you lost a pound,3
2773,the phone was dirty  and the inputs and music holes all were filled with dirt and debris,4
2774,my husband had a   so he loves the iphone    he like the price even better ,5
2775,take tooooooo long for refund for a defective phone  the only review needed is the quality of the phone  it had a shaky camera  i should get a refund no questions asked ,1
2776,we had no problems at all   looked brand new and easy for verizon to switch from old phone to new   rather than by a new sim card  can take the one from your existing phone and use it ,5
2777,quick delivery  great price and items as described ,5
2778,fast shipping  and worked right out of the box  no issues ,5
2779,i like it s size  my former phone was an se  my hand is small and find it hard to not drop larger phones  my   is almost the same size as my se was just a very little bit larger ,5
2780,it s a good phone,4
2781,i used the phone with at t for about nine months  it worked well  when i asked at t to unlock the phone so i could use it with another carrier  at t had no record of the phone i received from this seller  thus  unless i use this phone is used only with at t  the phone is useless going forward phones advertised as at t carrier phones should fall under the general rules and conditions of what it means to have phones locked to that carrier  at t can unlock phones that are originally locked to them  apparently  mine works with at t  described as  partially unlocked  by at t reps  but cannot be unlocked unless the original carrier is identified  this seller said it s at t  at t says it s not at t should it really fall to me  the consumer  who believes  apple iphone       gold   for at t  means the phone is registered to at t    to resolve this issue  a consumer can t unlock a phone  only a carrier can ,1
2782,aesthetically the cell phone was in good condition  i left it charging until it reached    i turned it on to set it up  in that process the cell phone felt very hot  within two hours of lasting the battery low from   to     i went to sleep and the next day the cell phone dawned with    without using it  i bought this from seller buyspry  he s been trying to call them  but i haven t been able to communicate  so i requested a refund through amazon ,2
2783,it’s lit deadass it’s an iphone   camera quality is lit and battery life is dope last for like     hrs and i use my phone all day,5
2784,it works perfectly  i bought it unlocked and works in uruguay ,5
2785,i got this phone for my daughter and we had to take it to t mobile because it said it was an unlocked phone but it wasn t    unlocked so had to have them unlock it for she could use it  will never buy again from this person,2
2786,i got a iphone   from buy spry i had a few problems with it after i called customer service i returned it and i m getting another one coming in soon,3
2787,this product is awesome  it was a gift that turned into a replacement phone for my son ,5
2788,it kept flashing screens then turning off  i had to go in person to return it to ups because they do not pick up returns i guess  horrible customer service  it’s listed as excellent condition however my old iphone with a cracked screen works better  don’t buy,1
2789,it had scratches on the phone   but it was my daughters birthday present   did not feel like returning it   the charging port and cable were not apple  but i think it mentioned that   the phone was just inside the box   no wrapping whatsoever  phone is good i guess overall,3
2790,for it too be used works great,4
2791,i thought it was a bigger phone should’ve done my research before purchasing,3
2792,i was pleased on the prompt service an arrival of my iphone   it works great and is in great condition  i definitely will be purchasing again from this company  ,5
2793,great upgrade from    no problem migrating from old phone   looks great and works better than the   ,5
2794,phone works was in perfect condition cost less buying this phone than fixing my old one,5
2795,my iphone arrived in like new condition with no marks of any kind on the outside  the phone functions like new and i was able to insert my verizon sim card and use it with no issues on the verizon network ,5
2796,was like a brand new phone  battery at    and you probably don’t even notice the difference  don’t have the camera shutter problem everyone is taking about ,5
2797,desperately needed a new phone and i think we got a good deal with this refurbished iphone   ,4
2798,the phone speaker doesn’t work well   i thought it went through a check  ,2
2799,phone was quickly shipped and great condition,5
2800,el celular esta muy bien  tenia la batería al    y al     ya que compre   ,4
2801,i bought this phone for my grandson and he loves it,5
2802,product arrived as listed  as described  in decent time  i’m happy with the product   service  no complaints ,4
2803,very happy,5
2804,the camera shaking when talking pictures,1
2805,good value  working great,5
2806,it s a great iphone to have if you like small than it would be great for someone ,3
2807,do not hesitate buy from them  got it from verizon certified  wasn t sure thought it d be locked to verizon but no as promised it came as unlocked and phone had    batter life with   cycle count  wife loves it thanks,5
2808,i haven’t had any issues with this phone work’s great and it also works with cricket wireless,5
2809,took a while to get it to transfer over  everything is perfect ,5
2810,i was so worried about ordering this phones  since reviews go from      anyway  decided to give it a try and i’m sooo happy i did    phone is like new  battery life is    wich is fine  great deal  suggest you to buy it definitely ,5
2811,out of the box i only noticed some small scratches on the screen that weren t noticeable when the phone was off  as i continued to use the phone i realized the left speakers were not functional at all and it would stop charging when it was plugged in  the battery life on mine was also pretty dismal the return process is deliberately slow and difficult  i cannot recommend buying from this seller ,2
2812,i have to change the battery in apple store service  i expected a good battery condition for a few months not a few days   thanks,3
2813,i had this phone for like   months now and everything have been going nice and smooth no problems no scratches no damage   out of  ,5
2814,arrived on time and easy to set up  excellent condition like promised ,5
2815,it works good enough for my   yr old son,5
2816,very good product came on time it’s a safe purchase,4
2817,i got this almost   months ago  so far it’s performing good  just the battery came at    of its capacity  apart from that it’s a pretty good deal for a refurbished iphone  recommended ,5
2818,i keep reminding myself that it is a used item  battery life not great but better than my   year old    fingerprint is frustrating  i’ve redone it a few times and still won’t work  but it does the job for me and isn’t a bad value for the money ,3
2819,product came on time and in perfect condition  i would definitely reorder from this company,5
2820,the   iphone  ’s i purchased were in great condition  work as expected  and i consider a great value ,4
2821,the phone was in great condition and worked perfectly ,5
2822,perfect  i finally convinced my   year old grandma to switch to iphone and she liked the color and how easy it is to use ,5
2823,great phone  loved it  easy to use  but like any used phone  it has a bad battery life ,5
2824,i was quite happy with my purchase the phone is in pristine condition when i received it  battery health is     activation was extremely easy on verizon network been using the phone for over a week no issues,5
2825,this iphone   was like new you literally can’t tell if it has been used before just only had one tiny little starch on top but overall it’s a perfect value for your money kanga supply has top top quality renewed devices  definitely buying from them again ,5
2826,phone is completely free of any scratchs and blemishes  operates smoothly  no known issues the charging box provided wasn t compatible with the iphone  but i had a spare ,5
2827,item came in on time  phone it’s self was in good condition but when i try to use it without the charger it just shuts off  not even able to fully set up the phone  contacted seller and they will be refunding me my money ,2
2828,so happy with this phone  ,5
2829,just as described  some scratches on the screen  but they are barely noticeable  battery health was ok  according to the battery health section in settings  it could still hold    of its original charge  awesome phone for an awesome price ,5
2830,i love my iphone    i absolutely love that my itunes is on there and i can listen to my music  it has a great look and battery life  i got a great deal on it and it came when it said it would ,5
2831,the phone initially worked just fine and i was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier  a few hours later  however  i realized i wasn t getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps  while trying to make a test phone call  i was redirected to my carrier s customer service line  the representative informed me that the phone s imei  international mobile equipment identity  number had been blacklisted as lost stolen and that i would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either apple or verizon  the former carrier   this is unacceptable considering i paid for a fully unlocked phone  on top of that  the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly  phone calls are nearly unintelligible and music quality sounds worse than my iphone    i am very disappointed overall with this  renewed  product that amazon stands behind ,1
2832,the phone came in amazing condition and literally looked brand new  aside from the packaging  you would have thought it was a brand new iphone  the battery life was       fantastic for a used renewed device  i am quite happy and would purchase from here again ,5
2833,came in and was as described  unlocked and ready to go  hasn’t crapped on me yet so i’m satisfied ,5
2834,i don’t know about the bad reviews  but the phone i received works with no issues  i would recommend to a friend based solely on my experience ,5
2835,if i ddidn t know better i would have thought it was brand new  not renewed  no scratches or dents  bought for grandsons birthday and he is very excited to own it  excellent job,5
2836,i like being able to face time with people that don t live near me ,5
2837,i am shocked what    can get you  excellent condition phone  better than i expected ,5
2838,i need a recept for this order,4
2839,the description sold the phone    i purchased this phone as a gift for my niece before i went out to spend money on an expensive iphone    she kept telling me that her phone was dying really fast and i thought it was because she always was playing games on her phone but then i saw a video of people showing the battery life of a different phone and i was like let me check hers and i will know for sure and then bammm        battery life on a full charge     wtf    i wish i would have know this before the return window closed cause i would have definitely sent this s    back for a full refund    by the way it didn t come with a charger      ,1
2840,have problems with the phone most of the time,3
2841,i always buy a refurbished phone on amazon every   years  i’ve had great success with this  i bought this one   months ago or so and a week or   ago it was shutting down while on a facetime call multiple times  then today it just shut down again  it seems like the home button gets stuck doesn’t read a fingerprint or me pushing on it when it shuts down  super disappointed in this    purchase that’s already having problems shop somewhere else ,2
2842,battery life     barely had any scratches  came with a glass screen protector on already  but the second one i ordered didn’t have it on  it came in the box  overall good phone   it was time for an upgrade,5
2843,i don t leave reviews but i had to for this product   amazing  i feel like i purchased a brand new iphone   no scratches and it looks like it has never been used   very impressed ,5
2844,the speaker didn’t work  had to send it back  they gave me my money back though ,4
2845,this phone was in excellent condition and works fine  very happy with this purchase ,5
2846,impecable todo y la entrega fue muy rápida  todo excelente ,5
2847,works great for the price it is a great deal to replace my iphone   and i would buy again and recommend,5
2848,i was extremely skeptical about going with the certified refurbished option but this company did not let me down  you can trust this purchase completely and i’m so glad i did  it saved me hundreds of dollars and this phone works perfectly  i might as well as bought it new  no scratches or noise deformations  i’m pumped ,5
2849,this is legit  at first i was not sure about it  but when i saw it for the first time  i knew it was legit  i can only speak for myself when i say this was worth it ,5
2850,i must admit at first i was scared that it wouldn t come or something would be wrong with it  but it wasn t it came on time like it said   it s in perfect condition   sofarsogood i m glad i brought it   ,5
2851,awesome no problem’s at all…,5
2852,sound quality is poor through ear speaker unless hands off mode with speaker is activated ,4
2853,ordered at t apple refurbish phone  they sent me another severer i phone   not compatible with other at   t phones  couldn t retrieve all of previous info from old phone didn t get what i wanted ,3
2854,we ended up not needing the product but they gave us a full return and were helpful ,5
2855,the iphone  works fine the battery life is good  touchscreen works fine but it had few scratches here and there ,4
2856,received the phone late  found out it had a bad battery and a bad screen  i had to replace the battery out of my pocket because the company that has the phones stated it’s up to amazon to repair the phone and amazon said it was up to the company to do the repairs  in other words too bad we don’t care as long as we have your money ,2
2857,exceeded expectations,5
2858,my   year old son saved his money to purchase the iphone  it was perfect for his price range and now he can facetime with his friends and sister ,5
2859,what i highly dislike is that the battery life is horrible  the battery dies so quickly ,3
2860,work good but freeze up in different locations,3
2861,phone is a great phone  great first phone for children  the only problem is that the battery life not that long compared to newer phones ,5
2862,lo único y fue mi error pensé que había pedido el más grande,5
2863,great option for a phone if you don t want to spend a fortune  works good and battery health was in the   when i received it   all i did was switch my verizon sim card out and it worked without a problem ,5
2864,ordered iphone    really surprised that in cake in such great condition  i don’t usually write reviews but this phone is almost in absolutely perfect condition  very very minor scratching on screen but the rest of the phone is perfect ,5
2865,paid for the excelent condition iphone   and i recieve this cant even hold a full battery charge and i havent even had the phone for   this company is a joke save ur money go and buy one that works ,1
2866,everything about this product has been perfect  the quality was indistinguishable from new  it has functioned reliably and perfectly since i received it  this would have been an easy   star review except for one thing this is a refurb unit from japan  which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted  turned down  or turned off that one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me  as i primarily  used to   use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes  now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover ,2
2867,love the face recognition and the fingerprint still learning about the iphone ,5
2868,i really liked the phone until i realized when you take pictures the shutter sound doesn t go away even when you silence your phone  i found out that phones made in china have this feature since it s illegal to silence phones while taking pictures there  was completely unaware this would happen and i m disappointed ,3
2869,el producto llego a los   dias de la compra en excelente estado y con la batería en condiciones del    muy conforme,5
2870,exactly as seller stated  beautiful phone looks brand new  was even fully charged when arrived  everything works perfect ,5
2871,we have not had any issues  we are already at t customers so updating upgrading was not an issue ,5
2872,works great no issues as yet  i love it,4
2873,it work find except it did freeze sometimes on streaming,3
2874,so far so good  got it for my son and we haven’t had any problems,5
2875,phone worked for about   month then the charger port stopped working  it’s just paper weight at this point  first time buying a refurbished phone and something like this happens ,2
2876,i made the switch from android to ios device with this purchase  it has only been a couple of months  the phone appears to be brand new and battery life is very good  i am happy so far and hopeful ,5
2877,upon turning on this phone•started charging it because i couldn t turn it on  and as soon as it came on   minutes later it was at      red flag•set everything up  once my apps started downloading the phone got pretty hot will update this as life goes on ,3
2878,like new  very easy to use  no marks  great battery life  came with charger ,5
2879,loving my phone and service was outstanding  even got a new case  but no transfer cable to aux cable that would’ve been included i guess to new apple phone  hoping all continues functioning well  service was great and even arrived a day early ,5
2880,upon taking the phone out of the box i noticed there was debris under the plastic which leads me to believe the phone may not have been cleaned  also there’s noticeable redness in the camera flash circle on the back of the phone  water damage    i just hope the phone lasts,3
2881,i really like it  it came with a glass screen protector so that’s cool  battery works well  i’ve had no problems so far  came a little bit scratched on the lower back but it’s no big deal and overall  it looks brand new ,5
2882,the phones are working well for us  thank you very much   ,5
2883,el único pero que tengo es que pedí un color y me llego otro  por lo demás estoy contenta ,4
2884,at half the retail price of a new one which works out fine when you are giving the phone to your child,4
2885,it gets way to many telemarketing calls ,3
2886,phone looks like it’s brand new and i saved myself a lot of money ,5
2887,works great  can get it turned on with any carrier ,5
2888,my son is very happy with this phone  so far so good ,5
2889,it came on time  it looks new    no scratches or dent  with minimal wear  very tiny case mark at the back of camera   i m happy with my purchase  thanks to the seller and amazon    would definitely buy again and would highly recommend to everyone   ,5
2890,high quality price  all the functions are good  the battery is quick to charge  but the maximum capacity of the battery health is    ,5
2891,i evolved  within two years from android to  iphone   to    and now  i will buy the   pro max ,5
2892,box was weird but good price and such,4
2893,an excellent purchase  looks absolutely like a new phone  there’s no way to tell except if you’re the user  and it’s only because of the battery life  i’m very happy with my purchase and a big thank you for the seller ,5
2894,i phone   was in great condition and worked well    a great value,5

2908,talked with company about battery running low quickly they said that i could return it but i have already got rid of my other phone and really have no backup until i get home in april,5
2909,three weeks in and it’s pretty good the battery holds a good charge and the touchscreen is responsive it is a japanese model  so you can’t silence the camera sound  i don’t need to take pictures secretly  do you ,5
2910,phone works fine and is in pretty good condition  i was unaware however that i was buying a japanese model phone  not mentioned anywhere  and now am stuck with a loud and annoying shutter sound whenever i try to take a picture and there is nothing that i can do about it ,3

2936,my so  bought this phone and it has worked awesome so far ,5
2937,the phone is fine and works as it should  but the battery will stay charged about   hours from   to dead as doornail  i need this rectified as this is my primary way to do business  not acceptable  please contact me ,3
2938,everything was fine until the screen started glitching not even a month in  now the bottom of the screen mirrors the top  depending on how high or low i set my brightness  it’s either really distracting or not very noticeable  everything else works fine and the glitch doesn’t show in screenshots or screen recordings ,3
2939,my daughter is unfortunately an iphone girl through and through so we got this for her for graduation  it arrived on time and as described  it has worked well so far  we ve had it for two days now  and my daughter loves it ,5

2945,la batería dura muy poco,3
2946,we got this refurbished phone for our teen daughter at christmas   it came as promised and looks brand new   easy to install the sim card and activate   definitely a better value than buying a new phone ,5
2947,this phone seemed to work fine  but it wasn’t unlocked and not compatible with xfinity  i’m in the process of returning it  i broke my phone so i was relying on this and didn’t have a phone for a week while i was trying to figure out what was wrong with it  it was overly frustrating without a phone for work and college ,1
2948,it great and work super well   the battery also last very long   love it ,5
2949,solid iphone  cheap too,5
2950,had no problem switching my sim card to this one  works great,5
2951,nice ,5
2952,case  glass  battery all in like new condition     would recommend this seller  synced with my apple watchos      and should last me several years of service ,5
2953,,4
2954,from the get go  battery performance was poor  after a few months the home button started making a buzzing sound  overall speed to open apps was slow  total waste of money ,1
2955,está como nuevo la batería está al    todo funciona perfecto y está desbloqueado para usar en cualquier país  solo que el cargador no es el original  buena compra,5
2956,the iphone   is incredible   all the reviews do not do it justice   i would highly recommend it to anyone ,5
2957,she loves it  it is her first phone ,5
2958,ordered this for my son for christmas  the battery didn t last for two hours of music play  very disappointed ,1
2959,best renewed product i ve ever seen  it looks mint brand new  ,5
2960,arrived in perfect shape  no headphones  but for this price  that’s no bud deal ,5
2961,everything about this phone is amazing  the battery life is not the best  but the phone came with a screen protector already on it  the seller does a phenomenal job  thus product is good ,5
2962,beautiful color   everything is working well for me ,4
2963,very fast and well taken care of  looks to be a slight air bubble in the screen below the ear speaker but besides that phone is great  have to take a towel to get the sticker residue off but that’s nothing  ,5
2964,sometimes it act like it don’t want to charge but overall everything is good,5
2965,this was to replace my mom s broken iphone    nice phone ,5
2966,poor refurbishment  it appears that the proximity sensor was faulty despite the phone being approved by  quality control  all kind of interesting things were occurring on my newly refurbished iphone   from the first phone call to all subsequent phone conversations   the screen was staying active and illuminated when i was speaking with someone and i found myself often explaining to others that i hang up on them  muted them  sent them a random pic  etc    with my face the phone was returned and my money was returned as well   i understand that it happens occasionally but it was a waste of time that was a gift to my mother for xmas   another was purchased from a different refurbished and it works just like you d expect an iphone   to perform ,1
2967,i put screen protector on and it kind of sucks overall i am happy,5
2968,everything about the product was what was advertised  the battery health on the phone is    which is like mew   definitely worth it ,5
2969,brought the phone to us cellular to add to my plan  it wouldn’t pick up service with a new sim card  we tried mine and it seemed to work  but when we put the new sim card back in the phone  it would not connect  usc called support to troubleshoot and they said the phone will not work  it is not fully unlocked extremely disappointing  purchased for   year old son s birthday and now don’t have time to order a replacement elsewhere  not given option to overnight a replacement from seller great price  but this is not an unlocked phone ,1
2970,we’ve had our phones     for just over a month and have had no problems with them  they have no scratches and one even has a screen protector  very happy with our phones and would definitely buy from this supplier again ,5
2971,                    the media could not be loaded                  el celular viene en perfecto estado  con cargador certificado     de batería y sin roturas visibles ,5
2972,amazing phone and the price could not be beat  exactly as described and in amazing refurbished condition   i will be using kiss company again for future cellphone needs ,5
2973,it’s great  it’s a pretty color and works well  the battery life is poor but that’s to be expected with an older iphone  so it isn’t really the sellers fault  this is a great value for the price ,5
2974,i like it somehow,4
2975,it’s a good phone so far haven’t had trouble with it yet,4
2976,my son loves his iphone  works great and thank you for the extra case and screen protector ,5
2977,excelent condition    ,5
2978,looks good,5
2979,good value   gb,4
2980,good product as advertised no scratches as new works perfect,5
2981,phone is as advertised  customer service is excellent ,5
2982,so far  so good   great phone for the kids,5
2983,the phone worked great for a month or   and then apple did an update  the next morning the phone wouldn’t work  my phone service provider said they can’t do anything it’s fried  it was past the time to return and i’m stuck with an expensive paperweight and feel super ripped off   ,1
2984,my phone s speakers do not work  i contacted the seller but have gotten no response  all i wanted was for the phone to be fixed  i feel like this was a waste of money ,1
2985,this phone is good but the volume of the phone is so bad  you have to put it on speaker just to be able to hear the person you are talking too  who wants to shop with speaker phone on  no more iphone   for me ,2
2986,i love the service i got from these guys  the first phone got didn’t quite work but i sent it back and they took care of the problem  even in this crazy time  mvp,5
2987,this phone arrived and appeared as described  like new   easily accepted our carrier sim and worked great    for   weeks   yesterday the phone suddenly died   i reached out to amazon and they connected us with apple   they tried in vain for an hour to get it working again but couldn t   ultimately amazon accepted it to return  it had the   renewed guarantee  and off it went by ups today we ve had good luck with renewed items and this may have just been a fluke   but we decided to buy a brand new apple xr phone instead ,2
2988,this iphone has great features good screen sensitivity  even case on  great battery life it came well protected and in mint condition  i’ll follow with an update  right now just getting started ,5
2989,good value for this renewed iphone  no issues with it  worked out of the box as advertised,5
2990,everything’s working fine  looks and works brand new  the only part i don’t like is it’s    batter capacity  but it came with a screen protector already on  and i’m just in love with the color ,5
2991,the apple iphone   came in pristine condition  not a scratch on the device  the battery life is great  phone has been used for   weeks now and not one single problem  seller sent the phone quickly  very happy customer ,5
2992,perfect cellphone,5
2993,no issues with this phone it was    functional and works great ,5
2994,seems to work alright but the camera won’t work,3
2995,this phone was a  renewed  phone but you couldn t tell  there were absolutely no signs of use anywhere on the phone  no scratches  no issues with the screen  all buttons and all functions work perfectly  no complaints whatsoever ,5
2996,arrived in great shape  everything working perfectly  very satisfied ,5
2997,so far i love this phone  the battery life of course isn’t gonna be    percent but so far no problems  looked brand new and nothing bad about it ,5
2998,i m afraid the only good thing i can say was the fexex shipping   overwise  here we go   first the phone came doa on arrival  completely discharged   secondly the housing was replaced with a cheap chinese reproduction   lastly the screen had several major flaws  that held at two arms length could be easily seen   finally i will say battery heath was a disappointing     this phone is at best worth      dollars   it is a iphone and it has   flash  that is the only high point   i do not like to give bad reviews  but well i am a bit upset that seller under estimated me and expected me to  be happy ,1
2999,no me gusto para nada,1
3000,sucks  i hate the iphone   i got from these guys… the battery life is awful  phone runs extremely slow too  not worth what i paid for it at all  they sell junk  this is the second phone i bought off here ,2
3001,works fine and is in good shape  but bought it with the intention of trading it in for a promo   but it came up as a phone that has already been used as a trade in  so i bought a traded in phone  now i know where these phones come from ,2
3002,no problems or issues with this phone  very satisfied ,4
3003,came in quickly and in perfect condition  cheap price and hasn t given me any issues so far ,4
3004,the phone worked fine in the us with our existing carrier and was easy to set up   however  it must have been an asian model   the camera sound could not be turned off   we had to return it   seller gave us a refund without issue ,3
3005,worse decision ever  this phone needs to be thrown away  you get what you pay for  but you couldn t use this even for free  does not respond to touch screen  home button doesn t work  it s always on silent even when the toggle on the side is in the correct spot  screen freezes a few tones an hour  battery said    health  but after a full charge it turned off because of a dead battery after   hours  battery showed full then shut off and wouldn t turn on until after   min of charging and said     total crap  returning immediately ,1
3006,my son like the phone and he use it for his personal use ,5
3007,no negatives  phone works well and is as advertised  very happy with it ,5
3008,it arrived a day earlier than expected   since my daughter s phone was not useable  it was so appreciated,5
3009,very nice  looks almost brand new   battery capacity is however    nice phone tho ,4
3010,i use it all the time for everything that a phone is made for ,5
3011,buying a renewed phone was a great way for me to upgrade affordable,5
3012,pretty decent phone  paid almost the same for this refurbished one as is for a new one tho  other than that no complaints ,4
3013,perfect gift for my daughter  not ready for an expensive version  and still gets plenty of options ,5
3014,the phone looked and worked excellent  the charger didn t fit the phone so i contacted the sellers and they took good care of me immediately  i will use this guys again ,5
3015,this is my second refurb without any problems ,5
3016,no signs of wear of anykind  no scrathes on screen or phone body   everything on this phone works as described and indeed it is an unlocked phone  i m using it on t mobile network and it works excellent ,5
3017,phone arrived on the day promised  the cosmetic condition is excellent   would think it was factory new if you didn’t know it was a refurbished unit  transfer of data from the old iphone   was a snap and all functions on the   are working great ,5
3018,phone works exactly as you’d want a new one to ,5
3019,just like new   no issues  great phone  excellent value,4
3020,iphone in very good condition  i bought it for my daughter  it is performing like new,4
3021,after ordering a second phone because the first did not charge   this one has a camera that shakes unless i put a magnet on the phone   instead of giving it back and being without a phone i kept it and found the hack to put a small magnet on the front of my phone to keep the camera from shaking when i wanted to take a picture   not happy with my purchase at all ,2
3022,the phone arrive with no sim tray,3
3023,great condition and it came with a charger,5
3024,it looked and worked like the brand new one i bought for my daughter ,5
3025,los dos productos tuvieron problemas que tuvieron que ser arreglados para su funcionamiento  a uno no le funcionaba el sonido y a otro la batería,2
3026,bought this phone for my teenage daughter  she insisted on apple  so it was a good affordable solution for us  the only bug seems to be that she can’t silence snapchat  not a big problem in the grand scheme ,5
3027,the phone stop working,1
3028,i needed a cheap replacement phone asap  this fulfilled the need but many features don t work  i keep my phone on silent and the vibrate function has never worked  the downside of refurbished items is that they don t always work     ,2
3029,i received the phone and it was dead  charge it up at   and tried to power it on at     and phone still won t power on  am in  process of trying to get my refund ,1
3030,this is the second refurbished phone i bought in amazon  both have been perfect  no scratches and no problem with functionality  i know there is always a risk  but for the moment  they have worked very well for me ,5
3031,have had absolutely no issues with it the product came perfect ,5
3032,the phone is working very well  i expected some scratches but i haven’t seen any  looks absolutely perfect  battery life is also amazing  definitely worth the money ,5
3033,i bought this phone   months ago  and it’s still working perfectly  it came without scratches and a    battery health  it’s amazing  please don’t hesitate to buy because it is worth it ,5
3034,the only problem i had is that they said it was a gold iphone  but is rose gold ,4
3035,everything is great just the battery life sucks but i plan on buying a battery case to put the phone in  outside of that a great phone,5
3036,i recommend this item for you to buy it’s working perfect and works with any network i am currently using it with at t and it’s doing perfectly fine ,5
3037,i m not sure if it s the dryness of winter  but my print is being read very easily ,5
3038,refurbished is no problem  it works as it is supposed to work,5
3039,good price  and i certainly can t tell it isn t new ,5
3040,product was in perfect condition   works great  the chip was inserted and it fired right up  no complaints ,5

3042,sometimes the sound stops working and i don t know why ,3
3043,i purchased this phone and after only using it for over   weeks it stopped charging   it just would nt charge   after scrambling around the next day trying to find a phone i found a new phone i purchased and tried to return this one after forgetting to take the lock off they contacted me and said no refund unless i gave code   no problem i emailed back and gave them the information  then it was something else  no refund until you do this  then the next email no refund until you do this   i finally contacted amazon and they took the purchase off my amazon store card   you cant hold peoples refunds hostage because of a defaulted product   thank you amazon for the refund ,1
3044,battery life better than the iphone   he had,5
3045,phone was in great condition,5
3046,so far so good  have had no issues with this product yet  came packaged very well in a protective box and came with a charger ,4
3047,fantastic camera  terrific pictures i can take with this   i have had no problems buying from the seller any of the phones i’ve purchased from them  i even returned one that was not compatible and got a complete refund,5
3048,i love this phone   the screen is so much bigger than my se ,5
3049,phone had    battery  very minor scratches on the screen that was only visible when the screen was off and turned towards a bright light  i don’t think i’ll ever buy a new phone again because of the amount i saved ,5
3050,is good condition ,5
3051,i am new to iphones and i am loving it  i haven’t had a single problem with this phone and it was easy to connect my carrier to it ,5
3052,phone works great   like it was new  would buy again ,5
3053,funciona bien lo tengo en exuador,4
3054,it felt like brand new  of course you’re not going to get the full apple unboxing experience but the box that it came with was pretty well packaged  it included the charger and the sim card eject tool ,5
3055,very nice for the price  looks brand new  very well pleased,5
3056,no complaints  this refurbished iphone   was like new  not a scratch on it   downloaded thru bluetooth iphone to iphone in minutes  this is my first refurbished iphone  i’d do it again ,5
3057,swapped out for an iphone    worked perfectly with at t  ,5
3058,the iphone was delivered on time  in good condition and worked as expected ,5
3059,indeed pleased with my purchase  totally came unlocked to south africa  looks as good as new only a tiny invisible scratch behind the camera charger is working battery life    reasonable with the price charged its totally a certified refurbished iphone  ,5
3060,my granddaughter wanted this phone for her birthday  because we dont see them very often my wife and i relented and i bought this for her  i typically by our phones like this since i will not pay    for a phone  right out of the gate she couldn t get the phone to work properly so they took it down to the local apple store  the person there told her that the battery was bad  she wanted a second opinion so took it to a different store and they said it was a bad battery as well now  less then a week in  i am having to sink another    into a phone that was  amazon renewed guaranteed   i hope that this is the only issue with this phone ,1
3061,after three months my text data has stopped working for certain text and numbers  i real pain since one of the letters is  e   anyway it died after the   month warranty  would not buy another from woot via amazon unless you get the yearly insurance policy ,2
3062,when i got the phone  i was disappointed  but not surprised by the    capacity battery inside  i expected i’d be taking it in to apple for a battery replacement  anyway  but  when i took it to apple  they couldn’t replace the battery  they showed me pictures  where there was standing water and corrosion inside  needless to say  i was shocked  not only did i have the phone in a waterproof case  i only had it for a few days  and never had it near water  i immediately contacted amazon  who contacted the seller  the seller asked if i’d submerged the phone  i couldn’t believe it  after a few days of emailing  they agreed to a refund  i asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation  i use the phone for work  i missed out on money  they said they couldn’t oblige that  but  they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone ,1
3063,it works as if a brand new one  came right away  aproximately   daysafter iorder  great ,5
3064,reasonable price for excellent phone ,5
3065,the back camera glitches way to much for the phone to be brand new plus the flash messes up as well,3
3066,this is my first iphone and i really like it   it came without a scratch or blemish with the original iphone cord   i was reluctant to purchase refurbished  but for     the price i decided to try ,5
3067,the was a great looking phone but my t mobile provider could not set it up on my account  it was t mobile compatible but could not get the international lock off  no way to contact seller directly left message but no response had to return the phone  bought the same phone from different sell no problem ,2
3068,phone received is in excellent condition and all features are functional,5
3069,very nice product which i will enjoy using ,4
3070,this was a refurbished iphone  it had a very minimal  almost invisible mark on the side but everything else was just like new  works great  decent battery life reported something like    by the phone  best bang for the buck ,5
3071,after reading the reviews i was sure i was going to get some type of defect especially for the price i received the phone for  but so far  its been holding up well and i dont have any complaints,5
3072,reconditioned  but looks and performs like new  i couldn’t be happier,5
3073,a good used phone for the     did not come with original charge block  in fact it came with an lg charge block  other than that  it’s fantastic  would have liked some apple stickers but that’s just being too picky  ,5
3074,so far seems to be a good phone,4
3075,no problems for me  the only shortcoming for me really was that the battery capacity of my phone is   percent  could be worse  i know  but it also could be better ,5
3076,i like the phone   ,3
3077,after   weeks of having this phone  there’s one problem  the bottom main speaker stopped working and now i can only hear audio from the top speaker  the speaker used for hearing calls  now i can barely hear audio even at max volume  i don’t know how to fix this  i guess i got unfortunate and got a bad phone  this shouldn’t happen to anybody  by at your own risk ,2
3078,this is the second iphone i purchased from this purveyor within the past   months  first was iphone    they accepted the return  the next is iphone     each of the phones have failed due to error update is required to use cellular data  can’t make calls  the   was fixed once but now i am having that issue  and it appears it cannot be fixed this time  obviously this company is selling faulty refurbished phones update  the above phone was able to be restarted  but  once again the phone has failed for the same reason  i’ll be paying best buy another visit  hopefully they can work some magic and get it working again like first time  but they could not two days ago  not optimistic ,1
3079,the quality of the amazon renewed phone was excellent  looked like almost a brand new phone ,5
3080,came in perfect condition a screen protector  charger and a sim card pin haven’t had a problem yet ,5
3081,looks brand new  they were super helpful and i love my new phone,5
3082,phone came exactly as described  no imperfections and works great so far  for the    price tag  i highly recommend to anyone in need a replacement but not wanting to pay apples retail price tags ,5
3083,thanks got it on time and everything  and it’s in great shape,5
3084,excelente compra  llegó en perfecto estado,5
3085,the iphone i received is in excellent condition and works great so far,5
3086,is as advertised and working very well ,5
3087,the phone is in good condition to be a reconditioned product   so far it s working well ,5
3088,el equipo requiere una cambio de bateria  nada conforme con esta compra ,3
3089,phone works perfectly  was not scratched at all  definitely a great purchase ,5
3090,when i received the phone  the packaging looked like someone ran over it with a tank  i’ve had this phone for about   months and this phone has randomly shut off and kicks me off my wifi more times than i can count  the phone also keeps telling me to get a data upgrade which i’ve never had happen to me before when i’ve bought an iphone on amazon  i was trying to save money by buying a phone here  but i was just severely disappointed with this brand new phone acting like i’ve had it for   years ,2
3091,looks and works like new phone,4
3092,great phone  it does have minor glitches in the messages every once in a while  example  it’ll say someone else’s name in a message i sent  along those lines  but it was a refurbished phone  so i was not expecting perfection ,5
3093,it came as expected charger broke in a couple days and it didn’t have headphones but i expected that the actual phone is great and looks brand new battery a little worn but not horrible highly recommended,5
3094,phone looks great  no blemishes  runs smooth  just disappointed to see the battery health at    out of the box  would have expected a restored phone to have a replacement battery installed ,3
3095,after purchasing this as a spare  i travel frequently    months ago i finally found myself in a situation where i needed it  after unboxing it all seemed well    until i went to use it  the service is absolutely horrible and it constantly dropps calls and shows   bar of service where my previous iphone   that i purchased from apple worked perfectly  clearly the refurbishment was not done correctly  i suppose part of this is my fault for not testing it as soon as i received it  guess i am just out   bucks at this point  disappointing ,2
3096,perfect with no defects     battery life and easy setup   great phone  ,5
3097,this refurbed phone is not up to snuff  in call speaker is muffled and buzzy  the person talking on the other end is barely audible  there is also a scratch on the screen  am returning ,2
3098,my new phone is awesome just like brand new i can’t find anything wrong with it,5
3099,absolutely love this phone  it’s in perfect condition with a screen protector already on it and it came in   days early,5
3100,it came completely unscratched and the battery is great  it came with a working charger cable and a screen protector  it connected to my phone service as soon as the sim card was in  great product  exactly as advertised ,5
3101,clean  fully functional     battery   iphone   unlocked for verizon ,5
3102,the sellers were understanding and processed our return and refund asap and seamlessly  that being said  we did have to return the iphone due to a severely damaged battery ,3
3103,the battery will not hold a charge nearly as well as my old   my biggest complaint is apple themselves   their arrogance to change my photos to a short video   add music is    unacceptable   i am going back to  android  samsung  as they respect our photos   also the heic function is a pita  ,2
3104,this is the second renewed phone we ve purchased   very impressed   the phone looked and operated new   and  you can t beat the   day guarantee ,5
3105,very nice  like new  well package and sealed,5
3106,i would purchase here again ,5
3107,la batería no sirve  no me dura ni   horas encendido  y eso es si no lo utilizo  cuando lo utilizo me dura a lo máximo   horas ,1

3120,the battery will have to be replaced soon and i just got the phone   days ago   it will not make it through     days without a charge  i am older than   and do not use my phone that much so it’s not my usage   when checking the settings  it says battery is very degraded   will not ever buy a renewed phone through amazon   by the time i replace the battery   i have the same    wrapped up in the phone if i had just bought a new one ,2

3122,i’ve had the phone less than   weeks   the camera goes blurry when trying to take a picture   also  the battery barely holds a charge   i’m very disappointed   i took a chance  bought a refurbished phone instead of a new one  and   weeks later i am retuning it because it is defective ,2

3124,bastante bien para ser refurbished  tiene pequeñas rajaduras en la pantalla  el resto en perfecto estado  recomendado ,5
3125,i love the phone so much i suggest getting this phone but keep in mind the only problem is the battery life my is at    but everything else is good no problems at all  ,5
3126,it stopped working unless plugged in the charger  once unplugged  it cuts off without warning within   minutes and it ll show different battery percentage  everytime,1
3127,purchased for my mother and received a glass screen protector already on it  phone works exceptionally well  and was relieved that it was so perfect  just wish it came with headphones  but the buy was worth it vs buying from a retail phone store ,5
3128,this phone rocks  i was able to download games and apps i needed without having to connect it to itunes ,5
3129,product works well and arrived in time ,4
3130,do not buy from this seller as i bought an iphone and after a year  it wouldn t work and they offered no support   it is useless   very disappointed and out      ,1

3226,arrived in great condition  setup was easy   works very well ,5
3227,the phone i purchased proved to be unusable as it was stolen and blacklisted from network use  when i contacted support  they simply did not acknowledge that the phone was stolen  and after three days simply asked if i d received shipping labels to send it back  which i took as a tacit admission that they are well aware many of their renewed phones are from unscrupulous sources  i never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways   i strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable  at least for me  hopefully in the future kiss electronics can find a way to take better care of their future customers than i was taken care of  because this transaction could hardly have gone more wrong for me and i m incredibly disappointed ,1
3228,touch screen doesn t work  battery doesn t last for   hrs  worthless  could not submit this if i didn t put at least one star in the lines above  doesn t rate one star ,1
3229,great shape,5
3230,got this thing unlocked   up and running in no time with my own i d and email address   no scratches or defects   looks brand new but comes in a generic box   had charger with it ,5

3234,ok phone  not a bad purchase,5
3235,my iphone came pretty fast   it is in great condition but the charger that came with it unfortunately does  not charge my phone ,5
3236,received the phone in excellent condition and working order  popped out my sim and put in the new phone  transferred my info  and everything works fine  came with a screen protector and charger  would recommend ,5
3237,i received the iphone   with a new free screen protector installed  this was nice but unexpected  upon closer examination i saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so i removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches  the lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches  ultimately  i did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent   i am in the process of returning the iphone   and will find another vendor ,2
3238,works great  have att prepaid service  my daughter loved ,5
3239,device has a beautiful finish  definitely looks brand new and has been reconditioned excellently   device screen works flawless,5
3240,after hours on the phone with apple support  they concluded their phone was not unlocked the phone was returned   weeks ago and we still have no phone  i have talked with amazon customer service several times and they do not stand behind this product i ll never buy another  renewed  product from amazon again ,1

3246,phone worked subpar for the few days that i had it prior to returning  received it at    battery  the screen was off center and the keyboard was  extremely difficult to use  almost as if the touch screen was faulty  not only that  but the front camera had terrible quality for whatever reason  just atrocious  and any video recorded with the phone had some sort of static feedback in the background  i was hoping for a quality  refurbished phone and i was disappointed  i returned ,2
3247,everything came exactly as it was supposed and on time  plus the seller responds quickly ,5
3248,i only had this phone for   and a half months and already it has just went out on me and can t be repaired    i take great care of my phones all the time  so this is very upsetting ,2
3249,overall this product was very well working  no visible scratches on my phone and upon arrival the battery health was at     however the shutter noise for the camera will not turn off leading me to believe that this product originated from another country ,3

3277,phone looks and acts pristine  the phone tells me the battery quality is at     if i didn t know any better i would think this is a brand new phone  big ups to alpha wireless   ,5
3278,when i bought this phone  i noticed that my signal wasn t great  my texts and calls weren t going through and my phone was constantly saying no service  i contacted customer service  they told me to contact the carrier company  they tried troubleshooting my phone and resetting and updating stuff  still the same issue   they finally replaced my sim card and said if this doesn t fix it   then it s definitely a phone issue  well now it s too late to get a refund  i usually read reviews before i buy products  i don t know why i skipped reading reviews for this    don t buy from here ,1

3283,i am happy and like the color and everything,5
3284,this phone was described as in excellent condition  and it was far from it  pretty banged up  its okay to say good or fair condition but to say “excellent” was very misleading,1
3285,we bought two and both are great  battery lasts all day   mine had a surface scratch on the screen but other than that looked brand new  you cannot see the scratch with a case at all ,5
3286,the phone now keeps getting over heated  it begins to be a nuisance  i would not recommend a used  ,2

3300,everything takes   with these guys  first i pop out the    for the phone  then when i finally do get it almost a month later  i see the battery has been severely compromised by the previous owner   i have to give up my new phone   send it back  when they knew full well what they were doing   now the refund is taking    they should not be selling on amazon  it’s hurting their good name   ,1
3301,presenta muchos rasgados en la pantalla,3

3307,this iphone is great it comes with the charger and every thing works fine but there s just one problem it does not come with headphones but overall the phones great ,5
3308,don’t walk run away from this seller  i bought a certified refurbished iphone     i charged and it seemed ok and pack it securely and hand delivered it to my girlfriend in colombia  two days later she discovered that the principal camera doesn’t work correctly  it pauses all the time and the flash didn’t work  she had it check out by experts there and found a hardware defect   i email the seller looking for help or replacement   they didn’t even bother to respond   hope bad karma goes there way   shoppers buy from some one else    ,1
3309,great battery life and great condition  no visible scratches and dents ,5
3310,phone was really good condition  one small scratch on the screen but other than it looks like new  the battery health was only at    when i received the phone though ,5
3311,much better than expected   like a new phone ,5
3312,purchased the red edition for my mom  it s a refurbished model but it looks really great  very minimal hairline scratches on the corner of the screen but a protector will cover it up  definitely worth the money,5

3317,almost like new,5
3318,it works great and was way cheaper to buy here than from apply or through my phone carrier  came with a charger cable and box  also came with metal pick thing to help get the sim card out,3
3319,i don’t usually buy something as a ‘second’ but was very impressed ,5
3320,the phone is great   works good   i recommend it  ,5

3374,i bought this as an upgrade for my iphone    i had problems with the phone from day one  but since i had brought it back with me to peru  it was      to return the phone  i decided to hold onto it and try it out longer  the phone started working again for a few weeks and then stopped working  then  after a reset  it worked again perfect for a few more weeks  now the phone won t stay on for more than several minutes and i m back to using my iphone   and past the warranty  i should have returned it but that ship has sailed  they don t seem to be checking these phones very well in my opinion  you are better off buying a refurbished phone from apple which is slightly more expensive but offers better support and a longer more reliable warrenty ,1
3375,my biggest issue so far is that the speaker doesn’t always work and i’m having to restart the phone to get it activated  i’m now worried about what else is going to work intermittently ,3
3376,like new condition works great battery is decent  even came with good screen protector ,5
3377,iphone   arrived on time from the supplierthe iphone has some minor scratches  but is in good condition up to now the iphone   works perfectly i am satisfied with my renewed iphone   purchase ,5
3378,tenía rayones en la pantalla  el resto todo bien,4
3379,this iphone   is as good as it gets  i have no complaints except for the thumb print unlocking works only    of the time  for me  it s not a big deal ,5
3380,it does just what was advertised   i took it to the verizon store  changed everything over from my iphone     they put a sim card in and no charge   it works ,5
3381,like new   highly recommend,5
3382,it’s good,5
3383,perfect price value,5
3384,this is an amazing phone i love it,5
3385,no problems what so ever  the battery life was at    which was way better than i had expected  i have had the phone for about two months and it works perfectly with at t ,5
3386,yep  no complaints here  the phone performed as advertised right out the box  a year later  it s still performing very well   pleasant surprise  especially when we re talking about refub iphones  right ,5
3387,phone was fully unlocked as company stated took to metropcs they checked it transferred my phone over to this one same day with no issues ,5
3388,excellent phone  no issues detected perfect as new  ,5
3389,i was trepidatious to make this purchase because there’s no way to tell the quality of the phone before you get it  but i risked it and got the biscuit  the phone i recieved was absolutely perfect ,5
3390,great condition battery life was great  quick delivery ,5
3391,compre   equipos y de los   equipos ninguno vino en buenas condiciones  uno de ellos me vino con pantalla sin true tone lo que significa que no es una pantalla original  mucho desgaste y muy desprolijos le pongo dos estrellas por que funcionan el touch id  pero no volvería comprar a este vendedor ,2
3392,item clean and as described ,5
3393,looked like new   could not find evidence of refurbishment ,5
3394,gave me a battery that is below   percent and phone keeps restarting   stay the hell away from them  they tried to offer me   dollars for the issue  a battery is   dollars plus tax  keep shopping elsewhere,1
3395,the screen had some damage to it,3
3396,everything came out good      would buy again,5
3397,i’ve had this phone for a year now and i haven’t had any problems with it ,5
3398,good,5
3399,i have always had an android phone so it is going to take some time getting used to it,3
3400,great price and works great for refurbished   won’t ever by another iphone new     definitely will go this refurbished route every time ,5
3401,this good iphone,3
3402,brand new in the box with his own charger  works perfectly ,5
3403,got amazing service from the company ans our grand daughter loves the phone,5
3404,i will never buy a phone from amazon again  this is the upgraded refurbished phone you’d think it would have been fine or at least the support would’ve been good but the whole experience was terrible  as soon as it arrived the camera kept freezing on me then stopped working all together  getting support was a joke  i spent over an hour total with two different support people walking me through every solution they could think of  press this button  hold the sleep button  now try this and that and   other things  what a waste of time  i gave up and said can you send me a replacement and they never even acknowledge it just kept going with this and that to get it to work  i finally just submitted a return  what a headache  ,1
3405,phone would not read take my metro sim card  i need to to talk to carrier  why isn t the phone fully unlocked as said    ,3
3406,great product my daughter loves it,5
3407,got the iphone for my nephew so far no complaints ,5
3408,i received the iphone and it looked fine but when i activated it  i couldn’t hear very well  i took it in to have it checked and they said the speakers had moisture in them  i had to have it repaired  i guess you get what you pay for ,2
3409,great phone works really well,5
3410,phone appears to be in good shape with only a few small wear marks and works well   no problems found ,5
3411,live my new phone fr came a day fast too,5
3412,useful for gift ,5
3413,great refurb  works great ,5
3414,it has been a great value for the money  the battery has been great  and that was an issue with the last refurbished phone we got  completely satisfied with this phone ,5
3415,teléfono se usó para una sobrina,5
3416,i couldnt be happier  the phone came clean  looked brand new and with almost a full battery ,5
3417,this is amazing  literally like i just bought it brand new  it is amazing  no glitches and works like an absolute dream  will definitely go through this seller again if necessary,5
3418,wasn’t what i expected,3
3419,nice iphone but expensive,5
3420,used it for a trade in  no issues,5
3421,great purchase  works and looks like new,5
3422,good phone no problems ,5
3423,my son loved his phone works great with t mobile,5
3424,the phone is as good as new   no issues whatsoever    i would recommend this vendor for all your phone needs ,5
3425,for the price   not bad came with only a charger and the edges of the phone have peel marks and   overall  the phone is work and the battery life is ok,5
3426,excelent  but the batery is about    ,5
3427,this phone was supposed to be fully unlocked  and it is not according to a mobile company that we are using  this is so emotionally embarrassing because we purchased it for our daughter who was   now   christmas and birthday present  now we will probably have to pay extra to have it unlocked if it can be ,2
3428,so i bought this phone mainly because it had a warranty but watch out    days before the warranty ended i contacted them about the phones camera not working and that the phone would shut off and not turn back on for days at time they apparently emailed asking for the iemi number which i wouldn’t be able to get since the phone wouldn’t turn on  and i missed the email probably because it went to spam and was not able to provide this information so i wrote them again so even though i started the conversation and reported issues well within their warranty period and now it’s past their warranty period their response has switched to good luck  take it to a repair shop it’s out of warranty spend your money somewhere else if you value it   ,1
3429,great phone still hasn’t updated but great phone,4
3430,very good  condition,5
3431,great phone was kinda nervous buying a refurbished  but was definitely worth it just a few minor scuffs on the corners of the phone  screen was perfect and battery life is at   ,5
3432,i received the phone with a poorly replaced screen  the glass is cheaper than what is used on new phones  and is peeling away from the adhesive  the glass is so cheap it started chipping without hardly any use  i also have a lifeproof case on the phone ,2
3433,came on time  phone works great with no problems ,5
3434,great phone and price thank you ,5
3435,packaging was great  no dings or damage to the phone  satisfied with shipping  it just came with the phone and charger   great phone for the price   recommend to anyone for a budget phone ,5
3436,i could not be happier with this purchase  my phone looks and functions like brand new  i’m so glad i decided to go this route instead of paying over double for a new phone ,5
3437,basically got a new iphone   at    less  battery life was at    capacity and not a single mark on the phone even though it was listed at a  quality  definitely worth it ,5
3438,excelente,5
3439,love it well worth the money    very satisfied,5
3440,i am very pleased with the quality and condition of this product  it surpassed my expectations in every way ,5
3441,well i expected  at last  a phone in a box   ,4
3442,worked well as soon as it came out of the box,5
3443,came with a scratch in the screen  the description said there wouldn t be any defects within an arms reach  this is a christmas present and i feel bad about giving it now ,2
3444,works great i’ve had it since february,5
3445,very pleased   speaker has much better audio quality than our older i phone ,5
3446,great packaging  directions and extremely easy to set up ,5
3447,phone’s battery failed severely  will not stay charged unless plugged in and randomly shuts off  have had it less then   days……,1
3448,the phone was ok we couldn’t use it with our phone service so i had to send it back  ,3
3449,i have a ipad   the iphone is very similar  which makes it sort of easy to use  i have not mastered it yet  but i am working on it       so many features  it is a great phone ,5
3450,it was straight couple of knicks but good,4
3451,it  works exactly as advertised,4
3452,,5
3453,i liked the visual appearance of the phone  no scratches or dents  i was a version customer and purchased this phone as it stated it supported verizon  it does not  the ad also stated the battery would be    or greater  it was    ,2
3454,everything works fine thus far ,5
3455,no issues on my phoneeverything working,5
3456,love it,4
3457,good phone,4
3458,received a defective phone    the boot screen would display a line either above or below the apple logo occasionally  it would either show as a green line or a static    there was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps  i compared it to a friends iphone   and the problem was specific to the phone i    the touch screen would not respond    the battery would not display correct percentages  i once had the phone charging for   minutes and the percentage did not increase at all  after restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage   this also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the    the speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iphone  ,1
3459,the phone doesn’t have facerecognition,3
3460,not satisfied with the used iphone   i recently purchased   the packaging was good and it came with the charger   it setup nicely and worked fine for a few hours   all of a sudden the is shuts off randomly   not sure if its the battery and or software   it currently does have the latest software and ot charges when its on  only    i may need to return it ,2
3461,the device works great  even tho bought refurbished  however  it is almost identical to my    not worth the upgrade unless you have a very old phone or none ,5
3462,actually was better than expected  as it’s is renewed product  i was hoping to see some scratch or something  but it loooks brand new,5
3463,i wanted a cheaper iphone with a lot of storage  it stinks to not have the newest version and best camera  but i love it ,5
3464,a red phone is hard to find nowadays  it comes in good shape  only it s screen is a bit dim  looks like my old one s screen  which it probably is   but other than that all good ,3
3465,very happy with the phone  like new condition though the battery  not surprising and warned in advance  is not     i am quite happy with the purchase ,5
3466,every thing is amazing except the battery it only    max and it run low real quick but other than that it’s fine since i have a battery case ,5
3467,i bought the eight iphone for my son as a replacement  he has had it for six months now and has had no problems at all  cosmetically it looked as good as new ,5
3468,it works great   no problems at all,5
3469,excellent condition    everything works perfectly,5
3470,my husband has to constantly keep this on the charger in order to use it  how is this renewed  ,1
3471,na,5
3472,it has been working wonderfully ,4
3473,my son loves it the camera is amazing highly sugsested,5
3474,el celu llegó en perfecto estado  cumplió todas mis expectativas  ya tengo   meses con el,5
3475,the shipping was quick and the phone looks great,5
3476,looks brand new       iphone    red i m so excited i bought another iphone   rose gold as gifts for my   and   year old daughters    thank you trademore      ,5
3477,it was a birthday gift perfect gift,5
3478,i ordered   of these phones   one of them wouldn t charge after a week and after trying multiple cords and we had to return it   the other had problems holding a charge and we missed the return date by   days so i couldn t return it   i had to pay    for a replacement battery at a local battery franchise and now it works   pretty frustrating ,2
3479,great product ,5
3480,phone arrived and the battery is old not refurbished  i charged it to   percent in   hours of barely using it it is now at   percent,3
3481,needed an update and this phone filled my needs,5
3482,it’s ok,3
3483,great phone,5
3484,iphone worked great but i had issues with it after i got my sim card to work  it worked for about two days then stopped working again  and apple nor straight could figure out what was going on,5
3485,everything is fine as expected,5
3486,it’s small,4
3487,battery has great life ,4
3488,the phone came in pretty great condition and it’s still working good ,5
3489,    data plan works    perfect phone and perfect price  ,5
3490,just got it so far it s going pretty well it basically came brand new on how it looks with a generic apple charger so far extremely happy  i recomend,5
3491,works good without any issues ,5
3492,regalos…,5
3493,it’s was prefect for my mother ,5
3494,i do not have face recognition ,4
3495,phone only works when on speaker  also  battery life drains fast  barley use the phone asides from calling and messaging not that often ,1
3496,my new  refurbished  iphone works great  i’m extremely pleased with the size  this phone has remarkable features and memory  prior to purchasing this phone i was using an iphone se ,5
3497,this phone fills my needs well ,5
3498,so far this phone works great  have been using it for a couple weeks now  fingers crossed that it keeps working ,5
3499,good,4
3500,i am schocked ,3
3501,just like new at a fraction of the price of new  accompanying charger not apple quality ,5
3502,what my daughter wanted,4
3503,if i could give this product and vendor a zero i would  it is a renewed phone and they obviously didn’t do much to fix it  after three and a half months  the home button stopped working and it’s having all sorts of problems  they just said that it’s only warranted for three months and wouldn’t do anything when i contacted them just a couple weeks after that  they refurbish products just enough to get you through   months and then wash their hands of it  i would buy from another vendor who will stand behind their products  very poor customer service ,1
3504,there are scratches on the back of the phone as well as dents on two of the corners  you can tell it was dropped  works well otherwise  very disappoint with the cosmetic aspect of my purchase ,3
3505,have tried using it for a few weeks and this thing is junk  the phone is constantly hot and battery life is maybe   hrs   the charge cable feels like paper and can t use apple car play because it keeps disconnecting  and navigation is laggy  i got this phone just to be able to do imessage but with the performance    i m just gonna go to another phone ,1
3506,it is definitely a step up from my last phone,5
3507,perfecto,5
3508,shipping was fast and the phone charged up and was able to be used with att quickly   i highly recommend this seller if the rest of the phones are like this ,5
3509,received the phone and it seemed ok at first  the ios was about   major versions old so i tried to update it  but for some reason it couldn’t   long story short  after several hours of trying to fix it and a few more with apple support  it was determined that the hardware was bad  seems like this could have been determined when doing their qa  but i’m guessing they don’t do much if any  on top of all this after finding out that they sent me a bad phone  i had to pay for the return myself   happy ending is that i found the same exact phone for about    cheaper on another site and this one worked ,1
3510,so my daughter got her phone today it was like new she lost her phone and it works great and  it has a charger with it,5
3511,my son save his christmas money and ordered this phone  now after a   hour ordeal  first with amazon support via the number provided in this posting who could not fix the issue amazon linked in apple support who couldn t fix and brought on a senior apple support tech who could not fix the issue either  they indicated it was probably a hardware issue  called amazon back and they said sorry this is not their problem even though it says amazon guarantee  they finally agreed that they would email the vendor   that was the extent of their help and backing  caution on ordering items listed as amazon backed  doesn t mean much  not sure why they say  product works and looks like new  backed by the   day amazon renewed guarantee   if they don t really mean it  frustrated,1
3512,have had the phone for about a month with no problems  works as advertised and looked new  they also put a screen protector on it before shipping  that was a nice surprise,5
3513,looks brand new  very low battery life  very disappointed ,3
3514,in april  i was excited when my iphone   came in only to have it end within a matter of a few short months   the only good thing i can say is the camera was amazing  at least while it lasted   for some unknown reason  the lcd blew up inside the phone  unfortunately  even though it shows a   year warranty sticker on the phone you only get   days  i m literally   days past and neither ecommsell nor amazon can or will help   so  if you are looking for garbage  shop here all you like but if you need a phone that will last do not buy anything from this company   at this point  after many  many years  i m not even sure if i will shop on amazon either ,1
3515,good price  works fine  better than paying over a thousand dollars for a new iphone ,5
3516,great phone  battery was at    ,5
3517,it looks like new and seems to be working just fine ,5
3518,phone works perfect my son loves it,5
3519,battery life is terrible  just     hours ,3
3520,works great no problem with iphone   thank you,5
3521,received in good condition  battery is good  no complaints ,4
3522,the touchscreen hardly works and the battery drains quickly not really worth   ,2
3523,phone came in pristine condition  no scratches or mars that i could find   battery life is much better than my iphone    processing speed is at least twice as fast ,5
3524,why call it recertificated  it is like buying a used car from a dealership the one i got was ok  several scratches on the screen   otherwise it seems to work fine   didn t pay attention to battery life ,3
3525,looked brand new   no visible scuffs  scratches or scrapes  battery life seems near perfect  works perfectly  i am very pleased ,5
3526,didn’t even send the right color   cool bruhat least the thing turned on ,3
3527,the phone came in a timely fashion  wife loves her new phone   no scratches     no dints its all good  ,4
3528,i’ve been using this phone for   weeks  calls are so quiet that unless you’re in silent a silent room you can’t hear the call even with the volume turned all the way up  the keyboard occasionally doesn’t pop up  you have to turn the phone off and back on to get the keyboard working  made worse by the fact that it’ll only turn on after being turned off if it’s connected to power even if it’s fully charged  and there’s an annoying feedback noise on the playback of videos made using the front facing camera so calls  text  and camera are bad  hopefully amazon honors the   day guarantee because i won’t be able to return it until next week and when i tried to return it to the seller it said that had to return it by tomorrow ,1
3529,i haven t used the phone that much yet  as i just received it a couple of days ago   so far  however  it seems to be working very well ,5
3530,as described  sealed in vacuum bag  very carefully surrounded by protection bags  comes with charger adaptor and usb cable  fully unlocked  very pleased wit the order  i would recommend ,5
3531,nice job refurbishing the phone  i won’t   can’t pay for a new phone and am very happy with this one  it was a great price too ,5
3532,everything works perfectly amd it looks brand new  i was easily able to use it on metro by t mobile network  i would highly recommend this phone  ,5
3533,perfect replacement and i saved a lot  about half of what verizon wanted,5
3534,read receipts won’t turn off  lock screen randomly lights up,3

3542,this is the closest to brand new phone i’ve had in a long time  great battery life  only had one small blemish  that once in a case  was hidden,5
3543,do t yet know the battery life but the phone works great,4
3544,this is the   refurbished phone i have purchased from amazon com and i am thrilled once again with the purchase  arrived quickly  works beautifully  great seller ,5
3545,lcd screen was showing signs of improper installation with the corner screen showing some blank spots ,3
3546,we were pleased with the purchase until we realized that the rear facing camera doesn t work  all we get is a black screen when we try to use it  it was a real bummer too because i bought the phone for my ailing mother who had the opportunity to do a little teavel  only to realize that she can t take any pictures using her new  new to her  phone  quite disappointing  i haven t been able to contact the seller  hopefully this can be remedied sooner than later ,1
3547,i love it   it’s beautiful and feels very solid ,5
3548,bought this to replace iphone    i’m happy i did  only drawback i have found is has poor reception inside of the machine shop i work in compared to the   ,5

3573,phone looks new  work like new,4
3574,accurate description   stars  iphone shows some very slight marks but it’s something you would eventually do with a new one anyway  very happy with sellers description and price ,5
3575,calling and texting etc  basically everything,5
3576,i expected so much more from apple  this is my   iphone and i thought it would be so much better  part of the screen reacts to touch sometimes and most of the time not  it takes quite a while to load apps and internet and the battery isn’t the best either  everyone speaks so highly of these phones  but i am not convinced  i am going back to samsung as soon as possible  ,2
3577,works well no issues like new,5
3578,this phone was in great shape when i received it ,5

3698,the product is the best and the buyer is more than professional and keen for the customers and make a timely following upthanks a lot,5
3699,i don’t even know where to start  i didn’t even wanna give this one star  i bought this as a gift for my niece for her birthday once she got it activated all it did was mess up didn’t want to stay charged  no one could even hear her talking to us she couldn’t hear anything her volume didn’t wanna work everything about this phone is broken i’m still trying to figure out how to get my money back and a response from the seller   i took the phone to the nearest phone store and they told us it was a defective phone and that’s why were having the issues were having   ,1
3700,i’ve tried to contact the seller since receiving this phone and they won’t respond  the phone is slow the phone just randomly shuts off and takes for ever to come back on and when it does come on it has no service you then i have to restart it again  defiantly not satisfied  we could have fix this issue but the seller will not contact me ,2
3701,daughter loved it  works  and charges ,5
3702,why is there any negative reviews   my came a week a early and it’s brand new  omfg this actually amazing  you can trust them,5

3714,the phone is are but it have a problem of microphone,3
3715,the phone came with all it s parts and had no cosmetic damage  but the fingerprint scanner died within   days with no major drops or damage it s too much of a headache to send it back since i bought it as a gift for a friend in a foriegn country ,2
3716,good phone  solid price,4

3718,it amazing but i didn t bright headphone and i need them    just that  perfect conditions,4

3720,my   year old daughter loves it   she hasn’t complained of any issues,5
3721,personal use,5
3722,when the phone came it was dead  once fully charged i checked the battery health and it is not good  it says it will need to be replaced soon since it has experienced so much degradation ,2
3723,great phone and great customer service   highly recommend ,5
3724,the phone arrived with a dead battery  after attempting to charge it using a combination of cables and plugs  including what was included with the phone   the phone would not charge  it arrived at   and was back in the box five hours later and on its way back to the supplier via ups  might have been a fluke but thought i d make my terrible experience known  just the same ,1
3725,great purchase,5
3726,iphone came in very good condition   no scratches     battery  functions correctly,5
3727,i am not happy with this   i literally had it   weeks and it stopped charging and won t turned on and my daughter cracked the screen and now i can t send it back   it s her fault about the crack but it stopped charging and was gonna send it back and she dropped it   paying     or so for a phone you should have it longer then   weeks,1
3728,old good ,4
3729,it’s a good phone,5
3730,it came in great condition  no damage and great screen quality ,5
3731,i love this phone,5

3735,i really like iphone  ,5
3736,great pho be for  the price ,5
3737,seems to be working ok  as of now ,5
3738,be aware      i got poor used phones as renewed  battery health was     battery cost was   and the seller only agreed to issue    refund   very disappointed,1
3739,phone arrived as described and had my metro pcs store turn it on to their network ,5
3740,everything works ,4
3741,the phone comes in a white box  not an apple one  without original cable and plug with just a cable and a weird plug  its not worth the     i paid ,3
3742,screen too small  it felt very miniature  very basic compared to other iphones out there on market  i’d save your money and invest in a newer iphone ,3
3743,works perfect,5
3744,the phone is great    except that it is not fully unlocked   they are blatantly lying and ripping you off   it is gsm unlocked only   i was going to return it  but since i didn t realize it was not fully unlocked for a couple weeks  after my phone company had sent me sim cards a few times and we could not figure out why it would not work  all while living at the nicu with our baby   i will not get but half of my money back if i return it   therefore  i will keep it since it works  just not as a phone   rather than lose alot of money   i never leave mean reviews  but this time i must ,1
3745,bought this for my elderly mother fit her needs and budget   all was fine until a month after the return period ended   now her phone is overheating  shutting itself off  closing apps while they’re in use  etc ,2
3746,received in very good condition ,4
3747,looks like new  battery health is     all functions working  arrived within   days,5
3748,the phone has    battery life and zero scratches marks  the phone is perfect for my   yr old ,5
3749,this is my first iphone  i love it ,5
3750,phone works great  no problems so far ,5
3751,hardly any volume in the headset  the only way you can talk to anyone or hear anything is if you use headphones  the battery will not charge past     i m sure every refurbish is different but i found this one very disappointing ,2
3752,this was a very nice product i had no problem with how it performed it s just that i have been an android user for so long i m   years old and don t wish to learn a new operating system ,2
3753,good,5
3754,phone damaged,1
3755,it works like a brand new iphone i love it,5
3756,battery worked for one month and the died completely ,2
3757,loved it,5
3758,my son loves his phone  only issue is that when it gets hot it will shut down and he has to wait for it to cool down ,5
3759,love the way it came from the seller,5
3760,i does ok  it s just sometime you can t hear,5
3761,great product ,5
3762,this is the second device i purchased amazon renewed and it looks and functions like brand new    for   with amazon  i fully recommend ,5
3763,exactly what i ordered,5
3764,you know you are in trouble when you receive a card in the box saying to please not contact amazon if you have any problems  just contact them  the phone did not tun on for two days  when it did it randomly shuts off and restarts  the screen blacks out and when trying to get it to turn on it called   and set off emergency alarm while still blackouted screen  i do not have another phone to use and no money to wait   days after get the phone for a refund  it looks like they are just repackaging this phone and reselling t to the next sucker who orders this phone  no customer service at all      they knew was defective phone when sent ,1
3765,muy buen producto,5
3766,product in good condition  fast shipping ,3
3767,exactly what i was looking for  was like new,5
3768,i like it ,4
3769,the product came with a scratch and little divet on the screen  when i first got it  it had a screen protector on  so i thought the screen protector had the divet  nope   after accidentally dropping it  my phone screen cracked right through the divet  i have not had this phone long and am pretty disappointed as it is not even usable now  now the screen shows many lines of colors  i should have sent it back at the beginning when i saw the divet but was willing to work with it  make sure you do your due diligence when you first buy it to send it back if there is any issues with the screen it’s a true unlocked apple phone  worked with at t and verizon  we switched carriers  ,1
3770,buenísimo en perfecto estaso,5
3771,this is a great phone ,5
3772,the phone works,5
3773,todo muy bien    recomendable,5
3774,delivery was good actually before time and the product itself is completely all intact very happy overall,5

3779,i bought multiple and they all came in with great condition,5
3780,todo perfecto,5
3781,very nice product,5
3782,beautiful fully functioning phone,5
3783,the phone arrived on time  there are a few scratches on the screen  but nothing major  the camera and the fingerprint reader work perfectly  the battery runs out quite fast  tho ,5
3784,great phone,5
3785,product came before it’s scheduled delivery  works excellent no glitches just a good phone ,5
3786,phone came in and screen was insensitive to touch  contacted seller and refused to provide alternatives  do not recommend  no dot buy after having to wait over a week for delivery and even having to pick up the item  worst experience with amazon yet ,1
3787,there’s no battery life,3
3788,great phone no issues with anything so far cosmetically it’s in great condition i can’t find any blemishes ,5
3789,this phone quit working properly right after the   days return window  when attempting to talk to someone on phone  you can hear the other person but they cannot hear you  this is not a problem with other person’s phone because it happens on every incoming and outgoing call made from this phone  in all fairness  there are no problems with texting  games  etc  but the main purpose of a phone for me is to make or receive calls  this is not an occasional problem  it is every phone call made or received  also  i did not drop phone  get it in water  or do anything to damage phone  the phone has been in an otterbox defender since the day i got it ,1
3790,it was nice phone ,5
3791,the battery level was      and therefore  needed to be changed  not as described to be     battery life  and had a faulty speaker  meaning i could not use the speakerphone  had it tested out at apple store and decided to buy a later model  se   brand new for about    more on black friday special  taking into account a    gift card for accessories future purchase   i took a gamble and well  buying refurbished technology online did not work out for me ,1
3792,we  need to return it not working right the i phone what do we need to do,3
3793,it’s good for the price,5
3794,battery life at    and still there since ive had it    months  i m happy with it ,5
3795,honestly i didn’t know what to expect from renewed phone  but it surprised me that the phone i got looks like and work like he came right from store  i recommend ,5
3796,works like new  love the savings of a refurbished item ,5
3797,my phone works but the battery health was below the promised percentage and i have to take it in to have it replaced before it effects the use ,2
3798,muy bueno mi celular   gracias,5
3799,i like the product  but something is still not right with it  i think the battery or something inside the phone is loose  while shaking the phone  so it is not repaired correctly ,3
3800,honestly a little worried beforehand that something would be off  but its running perfectly after a week of use  couldn t have asked for better ,5
3801,no sirvió el cellular tenía un problema en la bosina,1
3802,just as promised   great phone  worked like new   right out of the box   it was a better phone than i expected   thank you ,5
3803,i like it,5

3805,great phone,4
3806,as advertised  the phone works and is exactly what i expected  it sure felt good to pay    less for a phone i use all the time  good value ,5
3807,screen showed a bit white had some stuff   it ok   jus wouldn t  recommend  if you love looking at videos  cause of the screen,3
3808,no comment,5
3809,runs well and no issues yet ,5
3810,this was a terrible purchase  the battery life is horrible  within the first couple months of use the battery wont hold a charge  the company will not give me any credit towards with the repair of a new battery  i recommend you keep looking for other phones as this one is terrible quality,1
3811,great deal great price,5
3812,phone was clean worked perfect     no issues   arrived quickly ,5
3813,i love my new phone,5
3814,my boys love there iphone  ,5
3815,runs smoothly ,5
3816,i had to get a new battery for this phone becaue it would not stay on  the phone was out of warrany and i do not expect the seller to repair this becaue i did not purchase the extended warranty  when i took the phone to get a new battery they siad its missing parts and the battery is just flopping around  it had one screw holding the internal parts in  the company said they will not work on it because it was so badly refrubished that i will have continual issues with it  i contacted the seller to try and reslove the issue but they have not contaced me back  i am stuck with a dead phone that is useless  avoid this seller   ,1
3817,my sister and i pitched in to get this for my brother to replace his  iphone     jkjk    iphone    but still ,5
3818,better than expected  did not come with headphones   ,4
3819,love the price,5
3820,phone was great and my daughter loved it for christmas ,5
3821,it was great and very nice,5
3822,this was well worth the money  minor scratches on the screen and a camera issue is all i’ve had but it cost   less so i’d say it’s worth the money,5
3823,so happy with this purchase  the phone was fully unlocked  looks practically brand new and has a battery with    capacity  just as advertised ,5

3837,i had screen freezing issues from the first couple of weeks  i tried to resolve the issues woth ios updates finally  the screen completely froze and would only restart by letting the battery completely die  then opening the phone again   why have a phone that is that unreliable   the answer to my request for a refund was   you are not eligible for a refund under the a to z guarantee  i have submitted an appeal   we will see how responsive and customer friendly this company is ,1

3855,i dont want to send it back  great price for i  but it only vibrates  it wont play music when i get a text or phone call   im rather irritated  do i have a warranty to go to apply store for them to fix it or do i need to mail it back  if i have to mail it back im going to be more irriated for paying all i did to my cell phone carrier for the hook up first month and activation fee  ,2
3856,excellent condition  like new  arrived promptly everything works apart from fingerprint function but i had the same problem with my last one  maybe i just don’t have good enough fingerprints ,5

3869,i switch from an android to a iphone  i know there a big difference in the two  either i bought a phone where the volume doesn’t work or there a secret to fixing it so the other person on the phone doesn’t sound like their in a tunnel ,2

3885,i got it fine and safe but then after using it for few months it started not showing apps  the name of the apps  and even not turning on  one day it couldn’t turn on at all and i tried everything possible  charging it  resetting it  but nothing worked  this phone lasted for   months  i don’t recommend it if you are trying to get a phone that will last for a long period of time ,2

4084,it’s all the real deal only downside is you can’t mute the phones shutter sound for the pictures but other than that it’s a good phone,5
4085,phone works great ,5
4086,not able to hear people when making phone calls and the camera is shaky when you open it  thought it was from dirt but when cleaning the lense there was no improvement  keeps dropping my network as well ,2

4106,none,4
4107,personal use and day trading,5
4108,recieved with a few scratches in corner of phone update  tried to turn it on with verizon  they told me it was not a verizon phone and it was also locked through findmyiphone which they said means it s likely stolen,1
4109,the original order i received was faulty and i immediately  within   days  asked for a replacement  the battery runs out super quick  scratch on screen it’s been over a month and i still have not received my replacement  very bad customer service  i need my refund now or send me a replacement asap,1

4114,excellent condition my daughter loved works fine,5
4115,phone arrived cosmetically in mint condition  however the battery was almost useless  i had thought a life capacity of at least    like it says in the description would have been usable but it was at    upon powering on for the first time and would fully charge in about a half hour and be dead in about the same time too  had to go out and pay for someone to replace it ,2
4116,looks like brand new  ,5
4117,still going strong for a teen  ,5
4118,this is like a brand new phone love it great for teens and kids ,5
4119,phone arrived defective and then had hassle of the return without an immediate credit to buy a new phone elsewhere,1

4129,apart from the many scratches on the aluminum body  it also had third party display instead of the actual true tone display  it was very obvious  the screen look like one of those toy phones ,2
4130,the battery is way below    the screen looks burnt on the sides  there is a small spot in the lower left side of the screen underneath the glass  repaired it myself and it looks like it’s never been opened ,2
4131,phone arrived in great condition ,5
4132,works great  i was a bit skeptical but it was perfect,5
4133,everything worked when we bought it except for forward facing camera   after   months the only thing that really works is the internet  after a couple months facetime quit working   then the sound quit working  now no vibration  complete waste of money  now my kid is phoneless ,1

4146,the phone just arrived  a day late  but was in perfect condition  so far it is working perfectly and we are happy with the purchase ,5
4147,a gift for my daughter,5
4148,was extremely happy with the phone out of the box   no damage to it whatsoever  i live in poland but bought it when back in the states for vacation   was acting weird with my polish sim card in the us but chalked this up to the fact i was in a different country than my sim card   got back to poland  and problems continued      of the time i have no service  phone or internet   even though i have an unlimited plan   even when in a safe wifi area  i have no service   basically  i m without a phone if i don t have wifi to use whatsapp or messenger   phone is useless   very disappointed ,1
4149,i give this product a no star   i gave the company that supplies it   kanga supply   a no star they sell junk   do not buy    there phone only last a few days after warranty    junk   junk   junk  i’m only selecting one star so i can submit it otherwise they won’t submit it,1

4169,good product,4
4170,purchased as  used    love it   have not had any issues   battery life is excellent   great condition   well worth the  avings  ,5

4172,got the product in one day  it came in great condition and had no issues setting it up with my verizon network  just a simple sim card replacement ,5
4173,very nice,5
4174,siri does not work and causes serious crashes   i can use the home button for anything but siri   when i use it for voice text or reminders  the phone will do one function and then go into vapor lock  requiring several reboots and a timeout  power down  for at least   minutes to work again   in the past i depended on siri a lot  so it has been a big problem  and then i missed my   day guarantee window to get the problem resolved   know why   because i didn t have siri to remind me to get it done in time   this has been a sad waste of    ,1
4175,it’s seem brand new iphone   to me,5
4176,great iphone  looks brand new  good battery  saved a lot of money from buying a new one  happy with my purchase ,5
4177,i use it for my phone  also take pictures  use it to play games  to buy stuff  and to stream and cast to my vizio tv ,5
4178,very good,4
4179,lije,5
4180,the current phone i had was destroyed and i decided to  order a   phone rose gold unlocked  when i ordered it  i received a   phone white   seeing that i needed a phone i decided to keep it and use it but then is was locked   i followed all the instructions that came with the phone which specifically said that the phone is unlocked  but the phone is locked     the reason i’m writing this review so late is because i have a friend that unlock phones and trying to unlock phones takes time  he unlocks the most difficult networks and this phone just can’t unlock   i’m going to return it  i’m very very disappointed ,1
4181,affordable  just use as personal mobile phone,5
4182,excellent quality ,5
4183,i wasn’t happy with iphone but was very happy with the response from seller  very willing to work with me  thank you,5
4184,it was in perfect condition  works perfectly  all features work  battery life is great  fingerprint works great  absolutely no problems  i connected my phone to metro ,5
4185,i dislike the quality of the phone  it goes dark and i have to keep turning the light up  it doesn’t recognize my security methods and it goes dead quickly to have so many gigabytes  it acts like i have none  never again will i buy a refurbished phone,1
4186,great ,5
4187,very nice,5
4188,within minutes of setting up phone the device started crashing   after a   hour period it crashed some   times and would take several minutes to attempt to get phone to turn on returning was difficult as amazon wanted to troubleshoot issue and not return  refund   they proceeded to want my apple id so they could share my screen which is not advisable phone arrived looking fine but obviously was damaged beyond reuse ,1
4189,everything good on this phone except the microphone isn t working  have tried multiple things to fix  nothing working  when someone calls  i can hear them  but they can t hear me ,2
4190,i got the iphone   and everything seems great until i got a phone call   the earpiece has such a crackle and static that i can barely understand the caller   otherwise it is a perfect phone ,2
4191,great,5
4192,phone has not visible blemishes   everything working as expected for a renewed phone ,5
4193,phone works great   the wife is happy and i saved money   i phone   looked new and works great ,5
4194,not unlocked for sprint   had to send back and order elsewhere ,3
4195,did not work on arrival    stars is for the customer service that processed the return with no issues  ended up buying new   ,3
4196,the phone works well but the battery runs down fast and it didn t even come with the original iphone box and it didn t come with the original charger,3
4197,not worth the money  should have got a refund while i could as now i m stuck with a phone less than a year later that will not charge  turning it into apple and buying a new phone  disappointed as i bought another refurbished phone that lasted me   years  not a responsible seller or a good phone  avoid ,1
4198,phone works fine for what i needed it for to test our applications on ios  it is a pita to have to keep it plugged in all the time as the battery dies very quickly  certainly would not have been a good phone for use as a phone lol         update on this phone    months and it has died  won t take a charge and won t hard reboot  poor purchase,1
4199,i returned this phone because it would shut off randomly even though the battery is fully charged   i returned the item at a local drop box  and i never received a refund   i feel scammed  please advise ,1
4200,works properly with the bonus of unexpected case   screen protector,5
4201,good deal great item low price,5
4202,exactly what i ordered  inexpensive  and shipped really fast  happy to have a new phone,5
4203,this item came with a damaged main screen  i am not willing to keep this iphone for fear it would break immediately after its   day warranty expires  i decided to return this item before ever even using it ,2
4204,this was a gift for my grandson and he is very happy with it i have heard nothing about any issues ,5
4205,i can barely hear people i’m talking to  have to put it on speaker  sometimes they can’t hear me at all  i’m not happy at all  but   days are up  thus is ridiculous  ,2
4206,touch less activation workedautomatically twice w my old phone but then it lost all touch screen and fingerprint access capability in under a minute  both times  couldn’t wipe it clean after activating either because i couldn’t type in a passcode to get into the phone  erased everything from the old phone this new one was supposed to replace  i guess you take a chance with “renewed” items  won’t do that again   also drained battery    in   minutes  that clearly wasn’t tested either ,1
4207,i loved my iphone   arrived on time  no scratches  unlocked  working perfectly  i just needed to go to metropcs to authorize the sim card ,5
4208,nice phone glad i bought unlocked,5
4209,everything was great,5
4210,works great,5
4211,good,4
4212,phone works great overall save for one crucial feature  phone calls  when i attempt to call someone  i can hear them but they cannot hear me  i’ve tested all three microphones and they all work well  but for whatever reason calls still don’t work ,2
4213,like,5
4214,great price,5
4215,i ve had the phone almost for a whole month  and so far  no problems at all  phone looks like new  works like new  great all around ,5

4218,the phone arrived with only    battery charged   i plug in to wall charger and began transferring data from my android     hrs later phone still not charged   contact customer service   ordered new charger     hrs later phone still not charging at all and is now completely dead   contact customer service   phone broken pls return   unable to send replacement phone  oh   and by the way   all data must be deleted before you return it or you will not be refunded your      ,1
4219,works very well ,5
4220,no problems at this time ,5
4221,excellent,5
4222,this phone will not hold a good charge for more than     hours with amount of usage  i ordered an exchange phone but the delivery time will cause me to be without a phone for several days  i am waiting for the new phone  just got a text saying the replacement had been canceled  i now have another phone ordered and will return this phone when the new one arrives   feel free to contact me ,1
4223,the phone came exactly how it was described and it was cheap  no scratches on the phone what so ever   in love with it to be completely honest ,5
4224,entertainment,5

4231,beautiful  flawless  battery life works well and charges fast  been using for a month and it’s great ,5
4232,i got what i paid for  so far meets all expectations,5
4233,                    the media could not be loaded                  this phone was worth buying it came fast in a day early,5
4234,the value is why i made the purchase  so far  the phone has worked perfectly  arrived looking like a brand new iphone  no complaints ,5
4235,fast delivery and the phone looks new  i didn t have no problem when i had activate at metro pcs ,5
4236,just received for my daughter and battery is bad  will apple replace ,1
4237,the phone does not hold charge   cannot be returned because it was sent overseas as a gift ,1
4238,is still working,5
4239,perfect condition   good value ,5
4240,liked this one works just fine and it has enough space for all off apps i liked the price   space,5
4241,horrible company  do not buy from this company  bought a refurbished iphone    worked great for   months then internal chip went out and phone needs replaced  emailed company and they said since it’s out of   month warranty they won’t do anything about it   so now i have a    paper weight  money is hard to come by and unless you have money to waste do not buy from this company   we need companies that will stand behind their products and this one will not do that ,1
4242,great phone great battery  ,5
4243,everything came perfect i don t know why it has bad reviews ,5
4244,i had to change a new battery because it gave a service message on battery  the seller did a terrible job at replacing the cheap screen on the phone  it cost me    plus for replacing the battery ,2
4245,good phone,5
4246,had to pay a additional    to get the sim unlock  and i bought it as a unlocked item beware of what your buys may cost you more ,1
4247,average   ,3
4248,el producto llegó en muy buen estado  solo tiene un hueco casi imperceptible en dos esquinas  nada de que quejarse ,5
4249,so relieved it works pls don’t let this review forsake meedit       major hardware issues i have been forsaken,5
4250,excellent,5
4251,we purchased this phone specifically because it was advertised to be unlocked and will work with any carrier  this is what the description reads   this phone is unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice on gsm and cdma networks  e g  at t  t mobile  sprint  verizon  us cellular  cricket  metro  tracfone  mint mobile  etc     we just switched from one carrier on sprint  where the phone worked  to verizon and it does not work ,1
4252,as expected,5
4253,great phone   no issues   good price ,5
4254,it’s nice and compact it fits great in my hand and i my back pocket,5
4255,the sim card tray was extremely hard to get out   then i realized my phone came in with    battery life   i didn’t realize that a battery should be replaced at   percent   had i realized  i would have passed on this seller   refurbished is one thing   bad battery life is another   they were pretty arrogant in their email   so beware   your phone could come almost needed a replaced battery my sister bought a refurbished phone from amazon from another seller for around the same price and her battery life is      so i’d recommend shopping around ,1
4256,it works great like new,5
4257,battery life not good dose not hold charge and fingerprint reader gives me problems i still have to put passcode after the fingerprint,2
4258,phone came in perfect condition  unlocked as it was advertised  thank you ,5
4259,i saw someone else say they believed they’re came hacked but upon downloading i literally had two dozen problems with my banks and every phone on the network  save yourself financially and buy new once they have the ip address or icloud you’re screwed,1
4260,arrived as expected  functions as expected,5
4261,received with a very large and deep scratch on the screen  approximately     of the screen  the sellers description of no wear noticeable from arms length was not accurate for phone received  forced to return phone and wait on refund and repurchase process rest of the phone looked good  but the scratch was too large to keep when paying for a “like new” phone ,2
4262,it was a gift,5
4263,tammy was our go to person and resolved issue with expertise and expediency thanks much  we highly recommend this seller ,5
4264,so far so good  arrived quickly ,5
4265,by reading some other reviews and based on my own experience i feel as though kanga supply  probably doesn t do a very intensive quality assurance on their products  if i could guess  they get a lot of refurbished used phones  which for the majority of the time work fine  but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty  the phone i received wouldn t even turn on  despite trying to charge it with   different chargers  i guess it s my fault for not looking at their website  where they make no guarantees that their products work  if you need a phone immediately  i wouldn t suggest buying from here  unless your willing to wait     business days for an exchange or refund ,1
4266,no flaws  product as described,5
4267,as described,5
4268,very good,5
4269,phone arrived with no scratches  no bents  it looks brand new  there was charger but no earbuds  the phone works great  ,5
4270,great product and perfect price  phone works as if it is a new phone  very happy with the quality of thisproduct ,5
4271,great phone it works as detailed on web site ,5
4272,que se descarga muy pronto su bateria,5
4273,it seems to be in pretty good shape but needs to be charged a lot  sometimes it spontaneously powers off too ,3
4274,can’t use touch id,1
4275, ,5
4276,first off  the phone came with an aftermarket screen that was clearly raised about     of an inch out of the phone and not flush with the product  but that didnt bother me much after putting a case on after normal use with no external damage  the phone stopped working   just completely died   went into the apple store and they couldnt help  i just had to get a new phone ,1
4277,i am very happy that i didn t buy a new one   this one is perfect ,5
4278,so far so good  got phone set up with our carrier and is working up to our standards ,5
4279,great phone at a good price  very pleased with the purchase ,5
4280,great little device,5
4281,excelente super recomiendo,5
4282,good sirvice,5
4283,loved the red  hated low battery life  apple recommends replacement      approx     fee  no ear phones       walmart  i m having problems with the finger print recongination feature  fat fingers  poor reader abilites  i ll have to return the phone if my teck  can t fix this  phone returned,2
4284,it restarts on its own   it’s very slow to the point the screen freezes ,2
4285,the phone is very hot when i use it to chat with someone by video,3
4286,phone worked fine for right at a year and then would not turn on  the geek squad at best buy said it could be the battery  but there was no guarantee that exchanging the battery would work  was hoping it would last a bit longer ,2
4287,everything worked great the phone looks new,5
4288,for the price it should of been better,3
4289,very satisfied,5
4290,not sprint compatible  lots of wasted time ,1
4291,good product,5
4292,i haven’t had it long  but it came quickly it seems to work very well and fast  i really can’t say yet about battery life ,5
4293,perfect  works perfect  i love it ,5
4294,bought   of these phones  exactly as described and works like new ,5
4295,like new,5
4296,the battery doesn’t even last but an hour then the phone dies  not worth it ,2
4297,i just received mine  perfect condition  tested camera  touchscreen and making a phone call  everything works  if something goes wrong i ll update this,5
4298,looks new and works great ,5
4299,speaker garbled  returning  all else good,3
4300,came and was very slow ,3
4301,fits my hand perfectly,5
4302,so far  works as expected,5
4303,camera stopped working after   days  i updated it and did all the little tricks but it hasn t worked since  on the plus side customer service is great and they are helping me return it and already issued a refund  this is the last time i am buying a refurbished phone  just go to walmart and save yourself a headache,1
4304,she adores it,5
4305,this item is on the way       too small refund asap,3
4306,the screen has only a few very minor scratches that it is almost not noticeable  but in general the phone is almost like new   ,5
4307,the swipe screen bugs out sometimes and some formats doesn’t work on the phone to play videos,3
4308,the battery life is terrible   the sound on this phone is substandard as well ,2
4309,     not nearly as expensive ,5
4310,works perfectly fine for low price ,5
4311,very poorly packaged when i opened amazon box the phone was falling out of the box  there was no plastic film over the screen to take of as it says it’s “ renewed “ i expect the screen to come with that phone is completely dead as well hoping for good results when it turns on right now i am not impressed so far,2
4312,very satisfied,5
4313,iphone   will not setup for verizon because vender flashed verizon software off  will not take sim card   sending phone back to vender ,5
4314,the phone works very well ,5
4315,el equipo no estaba desbloqueado  apenas lo recibí coloqué mi sim  t mobile  y no funcionaba   preocupado hice pruebas con sims de otras operadoras y el único que funcionó  fue at t  llevé el aparato a una tienda apple y a t mobile y me explicaron que la única razón por la que no leía mi información era porque no estaba liberado mi mayor molestia fue que al recibir el reembolso de mi dinero me descontaron   dolares  no puedo estar de acuerdo con eso  me venden un equipo que no funciona y además me descuentan dinero espero que esta pésima experiencia sirva para tomar correctivos y mejorar su costumer service  ,1
4316,used one yet the best iphone i have ever had ,5
4317,working like rock  great pick  works amazing  very minimal wear which is expected ,5
4318,love it  great condition  works great  much longer battery life than iphone   or    very happy with purchase ,5
4319,phone works great,5
4320,my daughter loves it,5
4321,very pleased  like new in every way ,5
4322,my so loves the phone but the back camera does not work  just black blank screen ,3
4323,i am very happy with this purchase   pdi mobile was the seller    no issues ,5
4324,while i’d product is in good condition  the refurbishment is obviously a japanese or korean refurb— meaning the shutter sound will always be on  whether your phone is on silent or not  so snapchat  camera    anything that uses a camera it will always make the sound  not ideal by any means and should be mentioned in the description ,2
4325,excellent phone  fast delivery  brand new phone with accessories at an excellent price   i would definitely buy from this company again  thanks,5
4326,excellent iphone   for a reasonable price,5
4327,definitely was iffy on the purchase but love the phone and haven’t had any issues and was fully unlocked  ,5
4328,awesome seller  great product   ,5
4329,i purchased an iphone    the phone just arrived  it does not respond to my hand touching the screen  i am unable to perform any task on the phone because the iphone operates with the user touching the screen and the screen is responding to the touch i am completely baffled how a seller could send a re certified phone to a buyer without first testing whether the phone s basic function worked correctly  i am deeply disappointed ,1
4330,just a good deal,4
4331,you guys sent me a phone that cuts on in off by itself the battery dies fast,1
4332,la bateria se descarga rapido,3
4333,i upgraded my phone and it’s very little difference but i still appreciate it,5

4337,perfect condition  great battery  like new,5
4338,my daughter has had the phone now for   months and it still looks and works like it’s brand new ,5
4339,i do not believe that the phone came with    battery life of a new phone  or at least the battery life went downhill pretty quickly  additionally  from the beginning the phone speaker quality was poor   when talking on the phone people s voices sound weird ,1
4340,i didnt get to use the item   its not compatible with boost mobile ,5
4341,works for my grandma  hasn’t given her and problems it’s been   months ,5
4342,phones works great looks an runs like it’s brand new,5
4343,fast ship accurate description,5

4354,bien,5
4355,   recommended,5
4356,the product description says compatible with all network carriers  including sprint  but after receiving the phone and attempting to activate it  i was told by   separate sprint reps that the imei number will not work on their network  when contacting the seller they acknowledged this and only offered to provide a return label  i asked for a exchange for the same phone this time one that works with cdma  not gsm  and my request was ignored  why does the seller advertise  all network carriers  untruthfully  it s a waste to time to buy from here is the need is cdma   sprint and verizon ,1
4357,works great  no visual scratches ,5
4358,beautiful and it came earlier than i expected it to   ,5
4359,well when i say they threw this phone in a box i mean it  no bubble wrap for protectioncheap as hell charger  long story short theymay be getting this phone right back ,2

4369,the phone was in excellent used condition   inserted sim card and it started right up  no problems ,5
4370,everything,5
4371,this phone was shipped and received on time  the condition is great  however the phone does not hold a battery charge for more than   hours without recharging it  would not buy from this company again ,2
4372,within   months  the phone will not charge  it is not the charger because i’ve tried dozens of chargers as well  i usually don’t have an issue with a refurbished phone  so this is disappointing ,1
4373,phone came looking like new with adapter and charger  everything works great and phone was easy to set up on the sprint network ,5
4374,iphone    appearance is flawless   works like new  so far for first few days of use at least ,5

4432,great product glad i bought it came in looking brand new  definitely would buy from this seller again,5
4433,i got this phone as a no data device for my   grade daughter   we were initially thrilled by its capabilities as it seemed to work as a brand new phone would  quickly we realized we weren’t going to get much battery life out of it  but in the last month it has been challenging for my daughter to use the phone for more than   minutes without a cord   very disappointed as we were hoping this would last her through middle school   do not recommend ,1
4434,my cell phone works great ,5
4435,volume  is very low even if if ringer is all the way  i have to use the speaker to be able to hear the incoming call,2
4436,no complaints  i bought two phones and gave them to my kids using cricket as the carrier ,5
4437,everything was great but i didn’t like that the battery life was at    when i received ir,5

4439,we’re so happy with this affordable  renewed  iphone with great storage capacity   easy to recommend ,5
4440,only issue i had is the charging cable doesn t work  had to purchase another just to fully charge my phone ,5
4441,i loved it   i use this product for my own use because my original phone broke,5
4442,if this is what is called “ fully refurbished”then i don’t know what the so so refurbished must be like  very disappointed so far  keeps cutting communication    at times it’s not even registering when i call someone  or people call me   neither of us can hear the other   says reconnecting then shuts the number   i’m going to apple store next week   have checked out again     may have to return before july if these problems continue  ,1
4443,arrived on time and has worked very well so far,5
4444,good phone but doesn t hold a charge ,5
4445,great product,4
4446,better than  new  condition i can t yet comment on battery life and am not using the fingerprint reader thing,5
4447,was skeptical about initially  but received phone in mint condition  battery life was a bit lower    ,5
4448,i just received the phone  it seems to be in working order but since it is a gift it will not get set up until after christmas  i want it noted that it is not like new  it has scratches at the upper right corner  they do not look horrible but they are noticeable and also the speaker on the top is dirty and crusty looking  it had a screen protector on it but it was not sealed on  it was taped on  i m going to give it as the gift  but if the recipient has an issue with any of this i will be returning it ,1
4449,bought it as a gift for my mother and she is complaining the battery dies quickly ,3
4450,both phones look like they are in great condition  there were just two things i dislike  the chargers are not iphone chargers and the audio on one phone is damaged ,2
4451,it works like new   it is only a week old but so far so good ,5
4452,no scratches  works perfect ,5
4453,mint condition with a screen protector  packaged very nicely  ,5
4454,tiny hair scratch on the screen but its so nice for the price  im so happy with my purchase ,5
4455,phone dies after     even with full battery charged  bought one first and noticed this after a couple of weeks  but i thought it was only mine and then i bought another one for my husband and it’s the same issue  do not buy these phones ,1
4456,workin good so far     ,5
4457,the phone came with   day warranty  and it failed at about   days  i contacted the seller  but  he was not willing to give a partial credit on returning the phone for another ,2
4458,great iphone   great quality mint condition,5
4459,good quality refurbished unlocked iphone,5
4460,it is almost perfect   it takes a while to fully charge  but the battery lasts all day long  esthetically flawless   not a single scratch ,5
4461,has worked perfectly for me  i’ve been using it for about   months now and have had no problems ,5
4462,my teen son has had this for about a year now  no complaints  works as it should ,5
4463,perfect  phone came unlocked and in mint state  packaging is a general phone box no the original one  charger and cable are aftermarket,5
4464,thumbs up,5
4465,phone is in nice shape  battery life sucks also the charger they sent melted    they were quick to send a replacement charger we are keeping a close eye on it though ,2
4466,works well  even if it s reconditioned ,5
4467,buena oferta  como nuevo,5
4468,battery life was   percent when i got the ‘refreshed’ phone  would have liked that to be   percent as the battery is an easier replacement phone had a noticeable dent scratch on the bottom right which doesn’t look great but goofily is just cosmetic  although i wouldn’t be surprised it it affected the water proofing as the mark has to be caused from a falllastly i think i was sold a phone from japan because i am unable to take photos silently  which means i wake up my cat every time i try to get cute pictures of him sleeping  nothing i have tried has allowed the phone to silently take pictures,1
4469,speaker is not working   i am   and don t hear well,2
4470,it works great  my son is happy ,5
4471,very good,5
4472,bad bad product  do not reccommend  phone came with damaged charger and cant hear during calls have to put on speaker all the time  sellers were not much help with my problem said it was too late qhen i replied back  very dissappointed  i wish they gave me back my refund  paid for a damaged phone ,1
4473,product was better than expected  never bought a refurbished phone before  will consider buying for sellerr again ,5
4474,i was delivered the wrong color of the phone  ordered gold and received rose gold  this refurbished phone has a very bad battery life  was hoping for a better product  have to replace bater now  very disappointed ,2
4475,i purchased the   gb iphone   and it was perfect  took it to apple just to make sure  everything is running perfectly and connecting to my apple watch ,5
4476,about    cheaper than my carrier s  best price   easy to set up  put in the sim card  and it works great ,5
4477,disappointed on battery heath the last   phones i have received have had over    battery heath ,2
4478,motherboard failure suddenly stops working  feel ripped offi payed     dollars for   month this is the first iphone i purchased however online with amazon i personally will not purchase any more apple products with amazon online what a distasteful experience  amazon has lost my trust in providing reputable sellers online pay more and know what you will receive will last for years not month i will be reporting amazon and this seller to the better business bureau,1
4479,the battery was horrible  i bought a new battery and tried to install myself  stupidly   and ruined the phone  please don t do this  just return the phone for a refund or a different one ,2
4480,false advertisement with the gb  only came with    over priced for a used phone that is years old ,2
4481,the battery will last a day which is fine  other than that great phone ,5
4482,product arrived in perfect condition and unlocked as says in description,5
4483,fingerprint reader,5
4484,n a,5
4485,its a great phone ,5
4486,no matter what i try to do it will not work  i can have it flashes for another    which i am not doing  waste of money and then the seller wants me to pay to ship it back    not gonna happen,1
4487,it arrived in good condition and worked  can’t ask for much more from a referb phone ,5
4488,front camera was very blurry  exchange for the   plus,3
4489,i just need to know if you have a   plus,3
4490,i am happy to use that iphone,5
4491,perfect no scratches no nothing battery life is   perfect fully unlocked best phone ever,5
4492,this screen protector is so solid and feels really high end  i’m happy to have something that will protect my phone really well for an affordable price,5
4493,everything else was seemingly fine except the battery  the battery drains very quickly  confirmed that battery was degraded worse than the    advertised  had to replace battery to continue using the phone apple said the phone is not eligible for apple care ,2
4494,phone works great  saved a bunch of money   would do it again if need to get a new phone ,5
4495,n a,5
4496,great condition,5
4497,great phone great condition  family member asked for   today   will be getting another   today   ,5
4498,everything works its look brand new feels brand new im going to buy another one for my youngestupdate phone dropped not even that hard and display went black ,2
4499,great reviews and good product for great price  cannot beat that,5
4500,the phone looks nice but then after the set up the phone doesn’t work and the passcode i uses for the phone isn’t recognize  it just locks me out of the phone and then freezes  also it didn’t come complete due to that it has no wall outlet but a cord only ,1
4501,great,5
4502,love the hearing aid apt,5
4503,do not buy from this seller  refoned  the phone they sent me stopped working after two weeks  wouldn’t charge  i returned the phone and they tried to only issue a refund of half the purchase price as a “restocking fee” the seller wanted to keep    of my purchase price for returning the faulty phone they sent me  which is completely unacceptable  i had to call amazon and file a claim for the rest of my money ,1
4504,update feb        one year later    the charging function of the charger cord stopped working now   made a grave error buying this phone from whoever used amazon to sell their messed up item  no good  no good the  generic  charger   data carrier cable they added to it was not good for transferring files or photos from phone to laptop  it did not work at all  it did do the charging part of its job though    but only when attached to the electrical outlet in the wall but definitely not when i needed to charge the phone via laptop,1
4505,exelente,5
4506,good product,5
4507,it’s looking like it not original  also i have many times that it unreasonable,3
4508,as advertised,4
4509,good,5
4510,what s not to love   prefect condition  no problems  and a less costly upgrade from my   ,5
4511,beware        i give this phone a   star because the phones are not fully unlocked or carrier unlockedi bought   of the iphones   for my childrenas these phones for christmas presents  and tried to get them activated  to xfinity  which is with verizon   i was told that the imei are locked so hopefully amazon will refund me and take these wifi only phones back    i have called the third party seller but as of yet i haven’t not received any respondence    ,1
4512,this is a great phone   i like it very much   cannot ask for more   excellent product   ,5
4513,this seemed to be a good deal  until i realized that i could not hear anyone on regular function   speaker phone worked well  but that s not feasible in all situations  the touch screen was finicky   touch once  did nothing   touch harder or twice  and took me into view settings for that function  returned without a problem ,2
4514,great condition,5
4515,todo excelente  celular comprado en viaje para usarlo en chile  como nuevo  restaurado y funcionando todo perfecto a la fecha  realmente como nuevo,5
4516,i so far am very pleased with my purchase  looks and runs like brand new,5
4517,battery live is perfect,5
4518,my refurbished iphone   has had issues from day one  i tried to email and call the vendor for a replacement but i never got a response ,2
4519,at first i was a little skeptical about this product due to the reviews i’ve seen but surprisingly came as expected ,5
4520,i really wish i’d returned it right after the purchase but my son didn’t want to be without a phone  you literally have to have the phone up to your ear no background sound in order to hear from it  speaker phone is an absolute no no  i want to throw it out the window at this point,1
4521,no ear phones was in the package  i really need it please ,5
4522,shipped very fast  near perfect condition  and to clarify this model does work with verizon ,5
4523,very pleased with the packaging and the phone works great  great purchase and would recommend this company ,5
4524,so far so good,5
4525,nice phone  i like it very much,5
4526,wasn’t able to return telephone after the sound went out ,1
4527,i love this phone  i use it for everything  it even does great for games like pokémon go and wizards unite ,5
4528,appearance as new  operates perfectly  included screen protector  charging cable and ac adapter  very happy with purchase ,5
4529,i used the optimized charging feature to extend the life of the battery yet   months later it goes straight from    to dead  shutting off unexpectedly and showing    charge  otherwise with being overcharged    for an old refurbished iphone ,1
4530,our first smart phones reasonably priced delivery was quick phones are working well,5
4531,no me mandaron el cargador original,3
4532,they protective screen is put on wrong   it wasn’t lined up right  it offset,5
4533,good phone ,5
4534,as stated  there were no scratches or dings  looked as if it were new out of the box with   gb memory ,5
4535,great phone  i recommend this seller,5
4536,very poor battery life…hardly lasts for   hrs with moderate use… even if i don’t use it  battery goes down to    in   hrs…,1
4537,it looks like new    the battery performance is pretty decent though  i’m very happy with this purchase  ,5
4538,great phone must have been refurbished but i have had good luck with this phone ,5
4539,i ve had good and bad luck buying refurbs  in this case it appears the phone came with a bad battery  after a day it was dead  i would hope the refurb process included a new battery  one could waste a lot of time setting up a new phone  then going back to the old  a chance you take ,2
4540,me gustó en general el estado del celular para no ser nuevo  deberían tratar de incluir los audífonos al menos ,5
4541,the phone came broken  the home button was flapping off  waiting on a refund,1
4542,the phone only has    battery health  which means it has been used for at least over   years the camera is scratched with an obvious line across the camera lense the phone is at best a “used phone”  not a “renewed” product very disappointed  and i have to go to the post office and send it back  frustrated experience ,2
4543,very good quality,5
4544,when can i expect my refund  as i have returned this product ,3
4545,i don’t know battery life yet because i just received it but i am very impressed  it looks brand new and is great ,5
4546,my daughter loves her new phone and it’s a great thing it’s a iphone cause it lets me see what she is doing,5
4547,this item was defective  owner was notified  owner asked me to resend the phone in order to consider a return  i don t have another phone to re transfer my data  now i have to stay with in item that is not fully functional which i ve paid money for it  unfortunately   sad  unfair seller    ,1
4548,great phone no issues ,5
4549,this phone was not fully unlocked  suck a hassle trying to fix this issue  still haven’t fixed it    condition was decent  but that was to be expected  repeat  this phone is not fully unlocked,2
4550,i just got my phone today and the speaker is busted  the volume is very low,2
4551,used new stick on glass to hide cracked screen ,1
4552,very quick shipping  the iphone looks brand  new  is showing    battery capacity  and is working as expected ,5
4553,only had the phone for a week but everything is performing perfectly   my first refurbished phone but very impressed,5
4554,works great  looks almost like new  just a tiny scratch on the screen   battery health       still in warranty ,5
4555,i love this phone  beautiful look and feel  works great  fast  just all around good quality,5
4556,cuando le coloque el protector de pantalla  queda levantado ya que me dijeron que se nota que es una pantalla que no es la original  además viene con rayones,2
4557,had one before but it got run over   this one performs to the same level as my last one bought new,5
4558,this came and looked completely new  no scratches or issues  works great   owned for   now ,5
4559,bought this phone for my wife  looks brand new and works great  cant beat the price either ,5
4560,amazing i love it  no damage and not scraped  normal battery life    ,5
4561,i held onto this camera until i went to portugal to buy a sim card in december  when i got there i quickly found out the item didn’t work on speaker because the phone was defective  i will try the seller now to see if they change their mind ,1
4562,phone arrive just like brand new  other than the generic charger and cable which i expected from the description it’s been   weeks and working as expected ,5
4563,home button was not working when opened from package needed the phone urgently so i had to take it to a repair place myself instead of waiting a few weeks for another one  seems like a very basic function to make sure works as they said its been tested  avoid buying unless you can risk obvious malfunctions like this ,1
4564,battery only lives for two hours of light use  save yourself time and shop elsewhere  got it for my daughter who doesn’t use it much  the battery goes from    to nothing within     hours  contacted the company and they said they battery life was acceptable  save yourself the headache ,1
4565,this works just like new and we had no issue setting up with the verizon sim card  no physical flaws  fast shipping ,5
4566,great camera and superb seller support  would recommend this seller for buyers of refurbished camera ,5
4567,so far so good  every thing i’ve tried works  ,5
4568,it says in the description that the phone is fully unlocked  it s not okay  so first  it showed up at my house not even factory reset  then i find out it was used as a business phone for someone using t mobile  then i went to check the iemi because my carrier is a government sprint based carrier  it wouldn t work  it was not compatible despite being  fully unlocked emailed the seller since it s obviously not fit for my needs  it s currently only good for an ipod touch if that    avoid this at all costs  it s not a good idea  i regret every moment ,1
4569,this was  supposed to replace my other iphone for work phone   won t accept my apple id password  will not download apps needed for work  as i have to travel  please resolve issue asap as an iphone is badly needed for work ,1
4570,day    brilliant   well packed  received accessories and phone cover i wasn’t expectinggreat service,5
4571,phone was just as advertised   works great   renewed phone was in excellent condition  ,5
4572,awesome,5
4573,it was great    it works well with tmobile  it was a gift for my mom and she was excited ,5
4574,i’m very happy with my new phone buying your phone from amazon versus going through phone companies it’s better,5
4575,my son loved his phone to bad it could not come with a sim card,5
4576,didn’t give an option to ship it so it would arrive sooner ,5
4577,nice item  fast shipping,5
4578,exactly what we were looking for and accurate description   thank you ,5
4579,so so,1
4580,this product came as a complete disappointment  broken  turned on and off whenever it felt like  it didn’t keep charge  the turn on off button wasn’t even working properly and the was a glimpse  of light showing in the lower left side of the screen  trademore’s customer service was horrible  even though they accepted the refund request immediately  they never gave me the money back   it took me a month of begging them   and amazon finally stepped in and gave me my refund  i bought another phone from them at the same time  the other phone seems to be working just fine ,1
4581,less than a month in and the battery lasts an hour  useless ,1
4582,i am very happy with my purchase  it arrived on time and works perfect,5
4583,teenager needed new phone  in comes dad and prime   day shipping to save the day ,5
4584,my daughter wanted a newer phone  this one fit the bill  good phone for the money ,5
4585,bought this phone to replace my girlfriends iphone    seemed to work ok at first but then we noticed that it hadnt been updated in years and was refusing to do so  her iphone seven was running on a newer ios then the    upon trying to update  the phone went into a restart loop and wouldnt even stay on for more than   seconds at a time  in the process of returning it and hopefully finding a fairly priced phone from a different seller that does work before the holidays  would definitely not recommend,1
4586,mint phone  inserted my sim card and it booted right up,5
4587,perfect product  el mejor producto a buen precio perfecto estado y lo más importante la batería viene como nueva,5
4588,phone was in good exterior condition  however  phone battery was going dead after five minutes or so even when fully charged  this was although battery health was      even while it was charging it would go dead sometimes  don’t live in the us so was unable to return as i was on holiday when the phone was received  had to buy a battery and pay a technician to change it  do not buy ,1
4589,overall great iphone but i would of liked that it would of had a low light feature when taking pictures ,5
4590,product is legit and in mint condition  it seems to be brand new   no scratches ,5
4591,very good product at a low price,5
4592,only     battery life left  not the guaranteed    nearest ups drop off is   minutes away so not worth it to me to return asked seller for partial discount or credit but no response ,2
4593,works just like a brand new iphone   ,5
4594,the phone was basically like new everything seems to work fine on it very happy with purchase,5
4595,works great so far i’ve had it for a week and a half and there has been no problems yet,5
4596,esperaba que llegara con cargador  así fuera genérico   estado     libre para cualquier operador en colombia,3
4597,i would recommend it    great purchase  we just changed our mind and my son is buying a samsung,5
4598,excelent product  doesn’t seem refurbish  not external things to see  works really fine  battery life     i am very happy with this product,5
4599,i was worried about purchasing  a used cell phone but it has worked perfect  no complaints  thanks    great savings  ,5
4600,works great  but needs to be in better packing ,5
4601,i love my iphone   i purchased from amazon  no problems getting it set with with my phone company,5
4602,bought it on oct     today is feb    and the battery is already draining in about an hour  i am   weeks beyond the   day return policy  not good ,2
4603,i ve had this phone since aug    since yesterday  it has been powering off when it has a charge  today it went off at     when i powered it back on it was    within one minute ,1
4604,the battery only lasts a few hours  by lunch time ive to charge it again ,3
4605,i bought this phone for my spouse and so far everything has worked very well ,5
4606,your moneys worth ,5
4607,i purchased a fully unlocked  renewed  device and the phone was indeed not fully unlocked  shipping was fast and the cosmetic condition was also as described  i have no complaints there  however  the device is void null if it s not unlocked and thus  not compatible with my carrier  it was extremely disappointing as the description states that the device passed all diagnostic tests and was certified as being fully unlocked  this is major false advertising in my opinion  still waiting to see how the returns process will go with the seller   i will update this review if it goes smoothly ,1
4608,i bought this phone as a gift for a friend in uganda   the phone started malfunctioning almost right away   keypad does not work and phone turns off mid call unfortunately because of where the phone is being used it was unable to return and have not heard back from seller or amazon on ways that they could help,1
4609,battery life was low,5
4610,el iphone que  me vendieron fue una estafa  la vida util de la bateria estaba por debjo del limite normal  no puede funcionar mas de una hora sin que se apague  lastima que por ser un regolo  d cumpleaños lo comenzo a usar en julio  no deberian vender objetos en tan mal estado  me siento estafada por confiar en usterdes ,1
4611,great,5
4612,although i got the wrong size   i thought that i had ordered the plus size   it is a good product overall ,5
4613,battery dies quick,3
4614,this phone is awesome been needing a new phone for sometime now i’m satisfied with product,5
4615,excellent condition  the only way i was able to tell it was used was that the batter health was at    ,5
4616,works fine,5
4617,i ordered two of these phones  one for me and one for my wife  we are pleased ,5
4618,just like new  glad i saved so much money still paying off the new one i bought through at t ,5
4619,el hipone está muy lindo sólo tengo un problema con la carga que no aguanta y me parece que hice una mala inversión  ,2
4620,good,5
4621,the charging cable  usb adapter  and bubble wrap in the package were top quality  unfortunately  the iphone was stolen somewhere between the shipper and our house  and the seller refuses to deal with the matter  but i ve used the charger and cable several times on my other phones  and they work great ,1
4622,unfortunately my phone wouldn t power on after trying three chargers and two outlets  i called and after talking to two reps  no one could offer a solution so i sent this back requesting a refund i have yet to get  very disappointed  i still need a replacement phone but i refuse to pay for one when i haven t even been refunded what i m owed ,1
4623,so far i really like the phone  so i’m definitely giving   stars ,5
4624,works well  good battery life  thank you    great price ,5
4625,everything is like new except for the battery health which is    as described ,5
4626,the product never worked and i’m not really good at returning items   i have a hard time printing off the labels to send back   just wish it was checked out before sending to me    ,1
4627,product came early and everything was in order no blemishes what so ever,5
4628,it’s an apple product ,5
4629,don t like the fact that it doesn t have a port for headphones   otherwise  it s a phone  serves my purpose ,3
4630,love my phone  i ve had no issues with it  i love that it came with a screen protector ,5
4631,came in two day was suppose to take    phone is like brand new ,5
4632,purchased “fully unlocked” iphone   and it will not work with sprint   after entering the imei on multiple wireless carriers  only   worked with this “fully unlocked” cell phone after contacting breed who manages the sales of this phone   the response received was   “ even if a phone is unlocked  we cannot guarantee that your service provider will accept it  ”so buyer beware if you buy a “fully unlocked” phone or won’t work on all carriers as advertised   in the area the ad included all carriers including sprint however that was not true ,1
4633,everything came good and intact,5
4634,hesitant to purchase used phone  but turned out great  good price  easy to activate ,5
4635,phone works great haven’t had not one problem with it i love it honestly and would definitely order another one ,5
4636,i didn’t get the official earpods or the charger,3
4637,very apprehensive about buying this but it turned out perfectly and was exactly what i ordered,5
4638,don t buy the speaker is going out can t understand people don t feel like going the the hassle,2
4639,ordered this phone as a christmas gift  it showed up on time  everything worked on the phone  but the battery life was diminished  having a hard time contacting seller to be replaced ,2
4640,the kid got it for his   birthday  he loves it and it works great   ,5
4641,good,5
4642,a few months after buying  the battery exploded  when i thought this item it was labeled as an “amazon choice” product  no sure what means to me anymore  anyways  i ended up just buying the iphone se straight from my carrier ,1
4643,fingerprint reader spotty but it could be me  otherwise perfectly fine phone exactly as advertised ,5
4644,i bought it for my mom   works great   no issues and she loves it,5
4645,my iphone   works like new,5
4646,this phone did not work with my carrier even though i was assured it would   i never hooked it up because it was not compatible with t mobile sprint   i sent it back exactly how it was sent to me  all the accessories  in absolutely perfect condition and they charged me a    restocking fee     i have been communicating back and forth where they finally said a supervisor would call me but never did  i would definitely not recommend this seller it was a terrible experience,1
4647,do not buy and do not hook up apple account on wifi to it before u find out ur carrier can not can not use the phone and have to return it  i may be paranoid but even if u factory reset phone it never really gets deleted  food for thought  just might be a scam to get info on u  also my first review on amazon  never felt the need to rate a product til now,1
4648,i’ve had my phone for about   months now and i’m having problems with it ,2
4649,fue muy buen producto   fue lo esperado,5
4650,well the phone was perfect  everything worked however currently sending back because it wasn’t unlocked for my sim,3
4651,great phone for the value been an iphone user since its inception so i know value when i see it,5
4652,i am returning this product because it does not support metropcs and i assume that an unlocked phone means just that  wasting our time trying to unlock a phone that does not even support our current network is not fun  please be more specific about what networks your phone support  kudos for delivering a product one week early ,2
4653,the display is not as vibrant and colorfull as my previous iphone  while the touch screen is functioning properly something is not right with the screen colors  i suspect the screen was replaced with some cheap knock off and not an apple genuine part  i should had spent    more and got a brand new one from apple  i regret this purchase ,2
4654,the phone looked undamaged   when turning it on  the apple logo came on and would not advance any further than that   i tried several different ways to reboot it  but it stayed in the same position   i even called apple and they could not get it to reboot   i called the seller but they were closed for the day   when i pay over    for an item  i expect it to work when it comes out of the box   i called amazon  and they informed me to send it back and i would get a full refund  so i did just that ,1
4655,great phone  looked almost brand new  i trust amazon s certified used phones now ,5
4656,phone has minor wear and tear but works perfect  shipping was quick would recommend ,5
4657,battery doesn t keep charge,3
4658,i liked for the price  it came in great condition would definitely buy from them again,5
4659,first iphone i have ever owned  love it and was half price of new one ,5
4660,nothing is wrong with it also i do wish it came with earphones,5
4661,this phone looks and operates as good as new ,5
4662,compre   teléfonos y uno venía     y el otro venía inflado  con la pantalla despegada ,3
4663,great,5
4664,battery life is poor,2
4665,my only complaint is that the iphone was locked  otherwise  it was great  looked good as new and worked well  will have to return to amazon ,2
4666,i attempted to take this phone into the verizon store and get it out on my plan  but the verizon rep said it was carrier locked to another carrier  not unlocked as the listing said  i was unable to activate and had to return  believe all the   star reviews  this seller sucks ,1
4667,almost as good as a tuggie,5
4668,i was nervous at first but once the store activated the phone  it worked perfectly,5
4669,love it     didn t realize how small it was but it works for me ,5
4670,shipping was very slow and late even though i asked seller for days to ship it  phone is decent and works so far  wireless charging doesn t work as it should ,2
4671,pleased with my purchase  very minor wear  but it functions like new  highly recommended ,5
4672,i purchase this refurbished phone for my son and it was activated shortly after christmas     within a few weeks  the camera stopped taking photos  because that wasn t important to him  my son didn t tell me about this until march other than the camera  the phone works fine  however  this model doesn t have a port to plug in earbuds ,2
4673,awesome,5
4674,stopped working after two months  took it into apple and they said even though it was refurbished it had a bad circuit board or whatever  so i ended up replacing it  i couldn t even trade it in because it wouldn t turn on  it had the black screen with the apple icon  and apple couldn t reboot it ,1
4675,i don’t know about other people but this phone can in excellent condition ,5
4676,bought this for my grandson for christmas  works perfect and has no issues  thank you    ,5
4677,great phone,5
4678,all seemed well   i configured fine but then when i installed the sim and tried to use it  i found out why someone had dumped it   the sound and speakers were not good   so there    checkout was not so complete after all ,1
4679,everything works will on the phone   the battery life is amazing   it looks exactly how it is i’m the picture   ,5
4680,this phone is absolutely awesome and i’m even using it to write this review,5
4681,i returned this phone because it was impossible to turn off a very loud and obnoxious shutter sound for the camera  even when the rest of the phone was on silent or vibrate   apparently phones that were originally sold in japan or korea have camera noises that are impossible to disable   it was too annoying to keep ,2
4682,it came quickly  unlocked  and as described  our son was very happy to have it ,5
4683,good,5
4684,i bought this for my dad to upgrade him from his old phone  took long  understandable tho   the phone looked perfect so we went to his carrier to try to activate it  it came up as blacklisted  definitely read reviews before buying this  update  i got a replacement phone  it worked fine ,2
4685,not sure if renewed included battery replacement i run out of battery to fast for a renewed phone   pic quality is not as good as my iphone   and touch screen is tragging a bit  not sure if i just got a bad one of many  ,2
4686,the phone would not activate so i contacted my carriers tech support  they attempted and told me it was locked  i took it the the local carrier store the next day and they attempted to activate  after entering the phones i d  info  they said the phone was  blackmailed from their system   i ask what would cause that and they said the phone had problem been stolen and disabled  i don t need this fustration   your call though ,1
4687,like new product  not even a single scratch and works absolutely fine loved  it ,5
4688,my phone is perfect  i have no issues with it going   months very please,5
4689,he loves it  he can’t put it down,5
4690,i bought for my wife it is very satisfied ,5
4691,this was christmas gift for my daughter  it was just what i expected ,5
4692,i love this  it works so well and i am very happy with this and the price,5
4693,just as advertised,5
4694,i took the i phone   to verizon   agent put  a new sim card in the phone and there wasn t any service   could not connect to service   all other features in the phone worked very well   just had no service       very nice looking phone   sorry this didn t work ,2
4695,much more “used” than one would think  but works fine ,3
4696,super price  one of the best that apple manufacturered  looks brand new  great item,5
4697,very happy with looks  function and battery   i would recommend to others ,5
4698,my refurbished phone ginger print reader was working intermittently when i unpacked it ,3
4699,arrived like a brand new product  no problems so far ,5
4700,bought the item for my   years dauther who lives abroad  activated it only when i returned to my homeland overseas  two weeks in use  and the device stopped working  so frustrating   couldn t get any refund nor return the item  because too much time has passed and i no longer live in america      so frustrating   just lost my money  i advise against buying ,1
4701,phone doesn’t hold a charge it can only be off the charger for maybe     hours  phone will state i have service but won’t actually have service  doesn’t want to charge past    most of the time  have to reset the phone completely upwards of   times a day to stay connected to the towers  not a great phone at all ,1
4702,it looks like completely new  works very well  the battery life is very good also  happy for this order,5
4703,the product was received very fast   it was just as described and i have a very happy daughter ,5
4704,the phone looked brand new but i returned it because i don’t need it anymore,5
4705,was used for a gift  it was well received setup was easy and functioning well ,5
4706,best phone i ve gotten yet on amazon  in perfect condition,5
4707,phone was great ,5
4708,excellent phone   like new   didn’t look used at all   came with glass screen protector installed  nice touch ,5
4709,contacted this seller but have not heard back  the phone is dead after one month  will not charge has zero power and screen is black  should have bought from apple direct i am so mad that no one from this company has contacted me  live and learn ,1
4710,i bought this so my middle school child could have an affordable iphone ,5
4711,aesthetically the phone looks great  however there were some issues with the microphone  the phone is refurbished so i didn’t expect it to be perfect  but it’s been a struggle to make calls record videos ect  would definitely be worth the money if it fully worked ,2
4712,the phone was in like new condition but the speaker in the phone to hear from while on a call was low volume and muffled  i tried all settings to try to remedy the problem but it remained low and muffled  i had to return it to amazon ,1
4713,todo de acuerdo a lo especificado  iphone completamente desbloqueado  y en buen estado  mínimas señas de uso ,5
4714,very happy with this purchase i would buy from them again  excellent ,5
4715,i bought two     one was unlocked  the other was not  sent them abroad as gifts  and when tried connecting     well     one was not unlocked  they offered for me to return it and refund the money    only thing is    i was charged around       if i wanted to ship it back   if i wanted to return it i had to bring it back    they offered to cover       well  buy it to use only in the us     chances it is not unlocked  had to pay       additional to have unlocked,1
4716,el producto llegó muy bien a paraguay  funciona perfectamente,5
4717,works like new  thanks for providing this product at a reasonable price ,5
4718,si vas a comprar este producto asegúrate que no este bloqueado para tu país ,5
4719,it’s legit  i really can’t say anything negative about it   worth it    ,5
4720,my daughter loves her new phone and so far has had no complaints,5
4721,great condition,4
4722,gave this phone as a gift  couldn’t be happier  like brand new   ,5
4723,this phone will not let me download any apps at all  zoom  duo  webex  messenger  webex meet  nothing     it won’t remind ma of meetings  appointments even though i set it up in my calendar to do so  and it always tells me my password is wrong even when i change it as instructed to  i have missed so many meetings because of the many issues with this phone  this phone is wack  i thought y’all tests these products like you test for covid   ,1
4724,works and look brand new ,5
4725,i was very disappointed when getting this phone  first of all  it says it is up to date but it had a very outdated software according to the apple store and i couldn’t hear out of the speaker so i had to talk to everyone on speaker  i ultimately traded in my phone at the apple store for    trade in value and got a new   plus instead  it sucks because i paid    for the phone and had it for less than a min so i was out     buyer beware i would not recommend buying from this supplier ,1
4726,phone was just as promised   thank you,5
4727,didn’t come in the best of shape  scrapes  gouges all over corners  also scratched screen  could have been in better condition but overall okay ,2
4728,it s definitely  buyer beware  when buying a  renewed  iphone from verizon    because verizon s iphones are not truly renewed   the last two that i have purchased from verizon have had their battery health levels fall below   within three     weeks  and two     months  respectively   one of the two displayed a  battery significantly degraded  message   what a waste of my time and amazon s refund  shipping  and return expenses   suggestion for verizon   why don t you focus your efforts on selling iphones that have acceptable levels of battery health    neveragainfromverizon,1
4729,not the best   wont   keep charge       hard to hear sometimes,3
4730,item not as described  as a matter of fact  it was almost invisible  beware ,1
4731,it s republished one  and has been used everyday for   month but it s working perfect so far ,5
4732,received the information iphone everything is in new condition except for the battery  it says it needs to be replaced  which they said it would be no problem to give me a refund except that means waiting for them to receive my phone to issue the refund  then the wait for it to clear my account  then buy new phone and wait for it to come in  all while not having a phone period  just a hassle ,1
4733,works great  fully unlocked and had very few scratches,5
4734,not even in use for a year and the battery is shot disappointed     should have just bought a new one or got it from apple they have used ones too,2
4735,llego en día y medio  lo traje a colombia y funciono perfecto,5
4736,works as i anticipated it would   no problems thus far ,5
4737,it came in cracked and was supper small my daughter cried,1
4738,maybe its just me but when i pay    for an old iphone   even though it s refurbished  it still should work i sent this to my sister who broke her old phone and now she even though we bought this  she can t use be cautious of this seller ,1
4739,i was worried about buying a renewed phone but the phone works perfectly  i have no complaints ,5
4740,trying to make calls on speaker phone has audio issues ,3
4741,muy buen producto  no viene con cargador original en excelentes condiciones a un excelente precio,5
4742,it appears to new  no scratchs or dings found  works as new,5
4743,phone came with    battery life and died pretty quickly  i expected them to replace the battery ,2
4744,it’s really good came in great condition everything is great,5
4745,it works really good  fast delivery ,5
4746,excelente,5
4747,update   the camera stopped working  and right after the warranty went up  do not get  the only thing that is off about this phone is the battery  the battery needs   almost   charges a day depending on the apps i use  not too bad tho it is an only iphone ,2
4748,very good condition  with minimum signs of use,5
4749,this is the real thing  phone works perfectly  it is at t locked as described  but not a problem if you have them as your carrier ,5
4750,this is a renewed but as you see looks like new and work perfect,5
4751,no le anda el altavoz de abajo  una pena  no lo puedo mandar dado que estoy en uruguay ,2
4752,it was exactly what i was told   it came early  was the color and in perfect working order ,5
4753,phone was essentially new  no scratches or dents  i’m very satisfied with this purchase,5
4754,i ordered   of these phones and they were like new condition and worked as such,5
4755,phone showed up as promised  it was not the correct color and it was missing the door tray that holds the sim card in place ,2

4763,even arrived with a glass screen protector  ,5
4764,i’m happy  had a smal dent on a corner  nothing like what i expected though  great phone  seems new  and clean,5
4765,these are sold as  renewed  but there was nothing renewed about the phone i received  they just slapped a clear plastic protector on it to make it seem like new  the screen had scratches on it  the phone was dirty   dirt in the creases and especially in the speaker holes ,2
4766,it’s a great back up for the price i only use iphones,5
4767,thank you for the iphone  ,5
4768,the phone arrived swiftly and works great  ,5
4769,showed up broken  camera was shaky blurry and sound didn’t work,1
4770,muy buen estado  recomendable ,5
4771,worked fine when i activated it  had no issues,5
4772,prefect works great and cheap ,5
4773,after spending an hour at the verizon store to activate and transfer everything over  found this phone needs to be returned   in the process of calling about this renewed product   the phone only works using the speaker  drops calls and when speaking into the phone normally  the voice quality is muffled and the other person cannot hear me ,1
4774,just as the description says  clean  the charger seems original ,5
4775,phone will be on charger and at   and will drop charge within   mins,1
4776,it is a nice phone i will come back when i need a new phone ,5
4777,daughter loves it and it came early,5
4778,bought as a gift so i cannot give you any more info till christmas ,5

4780,funciona excelnete     desbloqueado  presenta pequeñas rayas en la pantalla ,3
4781,i am very satisfied with this purchase  shipping was fast  very good condition ,5
4782,the equipment was in great shape  and the memory was wiped  a great alternative to new phones ,5
4783,works well for what my daughter needed but battery died in   months,5
4784,arrived as expected   works great ,5

4788,phone is really like new  everything work without problems ,5
4789,used it for   months  still work well  no problem appeared yet ,5
4790,it is an excellent choice to get a cheap fully functional phone,5
4791,should’ve returned this right away but couldn’t spend any more time without a phone  i bought a refurbished phone prior on amazon and was very happy with it  but now i guess i’ve learned my lesson ,1
4792,nephew love it but i had to go pick it up from fedex in columbus to get it ,5
4793,i didn t expect much since it was so cheap but it works great  ,5
4794,phone was advertised as unlocked  it was not  we had to visit our carriers store  then call customer service  only to find out there was no way they could help us  charger that came with phone did not work at all  phone did have quite a few scratches  and customer support wasn t able to unlock phone or provide much help  if you buy a phone here it will just waste half a day of your life  and you will end up returning it ,1
4795,have just received phone and set it up today ,5
4796,it came in a really good condition  it was unlocked and all ,5
4797,i have bought this phone  i phone    and used for   months and the camera was not working  i have return the item and have to wait more than a month and still have not received the return money yet  i do not influence any friend of my to buy anything from this provider any more  so distressful and not convenience  sorry to have to say so if it hurt your feeling ,1
4798,it says in brand new sealed box but wasn’t  it was like a generic no brand cell phone prepaid cheap cellphone box  not brand new at all  it was setup and had scratches on the screen  looked good sure but not brand new in a sealed box like they claim ,2
4799,always afraid of refurbished products  but not bad at all wife hasn t complained yet lol its been over a year ,5
4800,a phone was created to listen by its skrakers the things  when this basic thing doesn t work as expected i scare the rest of the things fail in any moment  terrible quality inspection ,1
4801,mint condition  and work like a brand new one ,5
4802,it’s been   months the phone is working good ,3
4803,sorry i decided to keep the phone,5
4804,works great ,5
4805,the phone i received was not working and it would consistently shut down randomly and then after a few days it shut down completely and won’t turn on  honestly if you can’t even keep a product functional  don’t bother selling it  i’ve lost so much on this  what do you expect me to do now  we even showed it to a phone repair company and they said that all the batteries were working but they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with it although it’s functions seem to be fine ,1
4806,i shouldve bought insurance   i just didnt think the phone would break in   months   now the kid has to use aiphone   borrowed from a family member   you get what you pay for ,2
4807,the phone came with many scratches on the back and the sides and not to mention that the battery life was at    didn’t even come with a cord just the box,2
4808,i purchased this for my son s birthday and there is air bubbles under the screen which makes it harder to press the screen   i bought   different phone cases because the other   did not fit correctly because of the way the phone screen is improperly put on  i called customer service and was told i will receive a phone call from the seller but never did  i m highly irritated because this was a gift ,1
4809,this phone has been trouble free   glad i took a chance versus paying for a new phone ,5
4810,phone shuts off randomly  it’s annoyong when it’s an important call you’re on  i only had it for   days    but it’s refurbished so you risk it ,2
4811,phone was faulty and returned and still not credited   the battery will turn off if it was not attached to the wall plug  so the only way i could use this phone as if it was plugged into a receptacle very disappointed,1
4812,bought this for my girlfriend as a temporary phone but she cracked her screen and we took it in the repair store and they told us that the previous owners put tape and things they shouldn’t have in the inside of the phone and that it was garbage  don’t buy any from amazon it’s a scam every time ,1
4813,good condition  works well,5
4814,it came pretty much brand new  everything works  charger that came with it works  very satisfied,5
4815,bought this for my wife and she loves it ,5
4816,so far so good  don’t want to jinx myself  love this phone  very happy with it ,5
4817,it s been less than   months since i had the phone and the battery stopped working and i took it to an authorized apple repair shop and they did a diagnostic test and they said it is inoperable   i emailed the seller a few days ago with an automatic response and no contact after that ,1
4818,item looked to be in mint condition and battery was at    health ,5
4819,perfect    great condition even though it is refurbished,5
4820,i love everything so fari love my new phone,5
4821,the phone arrived in immaculate condition and after   months i’ve had no issues whatsoever ,5
4822,it’s what i orders     it’s pretty nice even had a screen protector already on the phone,5
4823,great condition   no scratches or dents and phone is unlocked  couldn’t ask for anything else  ,5
4824,it’s ok,5
4825,phone was delivered before expected  and in excellent condition  well worth what i paid ,5
4826,the phone doesn’t have portrait mode or some important aspects of a iphone  ,3
4827,bought for my daughter and she loves it and still has it lol,5
4828,hello  i purchased my phone in march  the screen started to lift last week  today my screen has a gray hue with light blue vertical lines  i understand these phones are refurbished  however i don’t believe the screen was fixed well before reselling  please contact me for my options as i am afraid the screen will completely  be gone  thank you,1
4829,iphone arrived in new condition and programmed perfectly  thanks  bc,5
4830,good device,5
4831,producto en muy buenas condiciones  sin defectos visibles  excelente,5
4832,i used this phone for my daughter’s first iphone i’ve only had it for       months and her battery life is at    the batteries sucks and i won’t recommend this product to anyone,1
4833,i have decided not to return the phone ,3
4834,as listed  fast shipping  would buy again from this seller  thank you ,5
4835,it was in mint condition and works perfect  it came with a box and charger ,5
4836,finger print reader sometimes don’t workbattery drains fast,5
4837,fue un regalo para mi hija de cumpleaños número  ,5
4838,great phone for the money ,5
4839,as described  great quality  no obvious scratches   battery at   ,5
4840,like new,5
4841,phone is definitely defective  the battery life is weak and it is not worth the price  will be returning phone do to not being able to enjoy the phone without constantly charging it,1

4848,worked well and had no issues  thank you for a good transaction ,5
4849,she seems to like it fine ,5
4850,i basically got a new phone i really haven’t seen a problem so far  no scratches or anything ,5
4851,exactly what i ordered,5
4852,not sure what to say  it doesn t indicate whether i can use this phone overseas,2
4853,love it,5
4854,unfortunately the battery does not last and had to return  never bought renewed products now i know why ,2
4855,bluetooth and wifi didn’t work at all so i ended up taking it to the apple store to see what was wrong and they told me basically phone was no good and you were not able to fix that problem ended up getting my money back for the phone… very disappointed ,1
4856,not what we expected by item description   it has low battery capacity  a chip  and a scratch   we are returning it ,2
4857,works like new  no complaints and it’s been good for the last few months ,5
4858,i had an android prior to this stupid iphone  i was talked into purchasing it because i was told it was easier to use  not true  it’s very complicated plus it has a minor scratch on the screen  hate it  hate it  hate it  i couldn’t be more dissatisfied     ,1
4859,not impressed with the refurbished option from this seller  it is having major issues since i powered it on  battery was definitely end of life at time of purchase so i basically bought a lemon ,1
4860,i think that you should mention it doesn’t come with a sim card,5
4861,wholly unimpressed with amazon s  renewed  service    i bought a phone compatible with t mobile  but our sims wouldn t work  after an extended support call we found out the phone was locked to a carrier in japan  it was suggested that i could call them to ask for the phone to be unlocked    yeah no thanks    also  the phone just randomly shuts off  mid use  and the phone s screen is black and the button is unresponsive  nice job at  renewing  so whatever  renewed  means to amazon  it is not  refurbished  functioning phone   returning it and shopping elsewhere ,1
4862,the phone is great and works well just like the add said,5
4863,we have been having issues with using the internet and wifi with the phone  service issues when we shouldn’t have them  and not being able to send or receive texts and calls as well,2
4864,muy bueno megusta amazon,5
4865,i’ve only used it for a few days but it looks like new and everything is working ,5
4866,the phone is great quality  no visible marks or scratches  and great camera and touch response,5
4867,this phone works as if it was brand new  no one would ever know it was refurbished ,5
4868,the battery must be bad so when u take the phone off the charger it immediately goes down by     ,2
4869,phone worked for a day then icons would disappear from screen   the “thinking icon” would randomly turn on and lock the phone for   minutes   so bad we went back to the old phone because it was not usable ,1
4870,my daughter bought this phone with all of her savings and only   months later it has crashed  the message is stating press home to upgrade but it will not go beyond that screen  verizon told us to check with apple store  which is   hours away  but it may or may not be fixable  very disappointing ,2
4871,los iphone siempre serán lo mejor a mi parecer,5
4872,good,5
4873,great phone love it,5
4874,i don’t like the battery life but other than that it is a great phone ,5

4883,perfect,5
4884,phone is in perfect condition couldn’t be happier,5
4885,works great  brand new basically no problem not a rip off ,5
4886,sound quality is terrible ,3
4887,longer battery life  wonderful picture quality ,5
4888,working great  will order again if need to ,5
4889,i got this for a gift for my wife  she loves it ,5
4890,the phone was received in an excellent shape  not a scratch and had    battery life,5
4891,item arrived within delivery window   item was as described  item performed as described ,5
4892,i just got the iphone    renewed  fully unlocked delivered  i was initially happy as the phone was in great condition  data transfer from old iphone went off without a hitch  the sim card from my old iphone even worked  unfortunately  that was as good as it got  and after using the phone for just a few minutes i realized there were big problems this iphone    renewed  would just inexplicably power down when my fingers were interacting with the screen  the so called  inspection  of this phone was performed poorly  very disappointed ,1
4893,the phone is not unlocked  it say it is but it s not and i took it to apple store the carrier and they couldn t lock it either  i don t want anyone buying these phones and they have to go through what it did  i had to ship it back at ups only smh and wait     days for my money back,1
4894,like the screen touch  display and fingerprint reader  great phone and voice calls and internet connection ,5
4895,this phone works great   second purchase from this vendor   very pleased with this phone,5
4896,has worked perfectly for the six months we’ve had it,5
4897,battery very bad condition  some mayor scratches in the back,2
4898,good purchase  the phone works great,5
4899,it’s a great phone  nothing bad has happened and it updates pretty well  ,5
4900,it’s a quality phone couldn’t beat the price for what i got ,5
4901,the product worked for about a month  however  it came in with fine scratches on the screen  which wasn’t a huge deal  small disappointment  then shortly after the charger started working improperly  you would have to sit it in the perfect spot to charge  now it will not charge at all  this was a very big waste of money   disappointment ,1
4902,the battery was dead which made the phone unusable from the start  i put a new battery in it for another     adding to the price of purchase  when someone calls me i cannot hear what they are saying not even with the loudspeaker turned on  very  very disappointed   will never buy another phone from this seller  ,1
4903,i’ve had problems since i received it  it occasionally won’t stay on for more than   minutes at a time and i have to factory reset to get it to stop  now the microphone doesn’t work— i’ve tried cleaning it and resetting it  i’ve had this phone less than   months support told me i’d have to contact apple to get it fixed— waste of my time and money ,1
4904,phone was exactly as advertised love it for my daughter,5
4905,product was defective and don’t hold a charge ,1
4906,when someone calls me i can t hear them hardly at all  and this is with the in call volume turned all the way up ,2
4907,the data cable is not compatible with the iphone  ,3
4908,battery was trash  got it home plugged it in and it would only work while it was on the charger  took it to a cellphone repair place and they said they battery was garbage  it wouldn’t turn out without a charger    dollars later we have a new charger  i believe that you had to know it was a bad battery otherwise how did you know that it worked ,1
4909,great,5
4910,definitely a deal  you get a case and car charger too ,5
4911,initially the iphone   seemed like a decent deal   but the refurbishment is subpar barely   month in the battery which was at    when i received the phone is failing  the charging port is also failing should have put the money towards a new phone ,1
4912,phone arrived physically in good condition  unfortunately it was not fully unlocked as described  despite contacting the seller they did not acknowledge the problem and eventually had to go with a return  they still sent me an email telling me that i need to return to them an unlocked phone had i received an unlocked phone i would not need to return it  i would not recommend this seller at all ,1
4913,definitely worth buying if you are in need of a new phone,5
4914,perfect,5
4915,  time i ordered one it had blown out speakers so i returned it and asked for a working one as it states that exchanges are an option  they just refunded me instead  i ordered another one  upon opening the package i noticed that the phone was all scratched up on the bottom  but not to worry they covered the scratches with a sharpie  they are junk  they are not refurbished  they are scribbled on and sent out with blown speakers ,1
4916,the first refurbished phone i’ve bought that’s actually held up for me ,5
4917,the phone won’t vibrate and that won’t flash the light when it rings,3
4918,really nice phone   thank you,5
4919,great phone only issue was the battery life is not great but ok  thanks,5
4920,the description of product matched the real gift ,5
4921,an amazing purchase     a gamechanger,5
4922,great phone   no cracks or scuffs   battery life is amazing,5
4923,i love it  ,5
4924,im curious as to why i didnt recieve earphone with my purchase,5
4925,sadly they had sent a phone that was defective and would shut down randomly  with research i found this was a hardware problem in some iphones  i wish they would have done more extensive testing on their products before shipping to customers  they provided a full refund in a timely manner which was nice ,2
4926,it all works but the whole back of the phone don’t work the back camera won’t turn on and the flashlight don’t work either ,2
4927,very happy with the purchase,5
4928,my son opened this on christmas and we took it to get it all set up and we found out it is still attached to someone else so now i have to return it and he has no phone  i’m sorry but people should not be able to sell these phones  if it’s truly being checked out then how can they not know it’s still on someone’s account  also the person who had this phone still owed money on it  what a let down on christmas      ,1
4929,just as advertised  perfect conditioni will buy from them again ,5
4930,do not buy your iphones or any phone from amazon  they’re absolutely trash even if the tittle says it’s “renewed”  the phone i received had scratches all over it  it lagged  i requested a refund right away  ended buying a brand new one from a retailer ,1
4931,so far great phone  unlocked as promised  great reception  performs as expected,5
4932,very please with the iphone  seems to work well  no issues  would recommend ,5
4933,the camera does not work when i realized the camera was not working  the return window was almost closed  since i had no intention to return it  i sent a message to the seller so we could try to fix it in time  but i had no answer  now i realize how important the phone camera is these days  and i m stock with a phone with a defective camera  i regret buying it ,1
4934,the logic board is faulty and calls would cut off  the apple store would not repair it  and we learned about the problem outside the return window due to covid delays  now the screen stopped working entirely  it s just a black screen now we can t return the product  short of     poor service from the company as well as amazon  if the seller is reading  please allow us to return ,1
4935,we were extremely disappointed and frustrated to find out recently that this phone was not free and clear when we bought from seller   we tried to unlock from att as were we planning to switch to another carrier   att could not unlock because they found out that the phone had not bee paid off by the party who sold or traded it to the seller of this product   will not buy from this seller again ,1
4936,quality product,5
4937,the battery life is terrible  it sat with put being used for   hours and went from fully charged to almost dead ,2
4938,phone looks brand new  easy to set up   so far very happy with the phone,5
4939,this phone may be sent to you with a battery that is  significantly degraded    my phone was received with battery already significantly degraded   the company apparently does not check the battery before they send it to you ,1
4940,this phone doesn’t come fully unlocked  and it also has a bad battery  better than my old phone  but still lame ,2
4941,there is a mark on the camera lens that messes up every photo since day    also the silence vibrate function has never worked  extremely disappointed,2
4942,don’t order from these guys  phone was junk  can’t get replacement till i send mine in first  i need phone every day all day   can wait a week or   to get another phone ,1
4943,it charges   our phones but didn’t charge other phone and it advertised it would do both,2
4944,i hate the camera shutter  doesn’t turn off   very noisily,3
4945,flawless customer support  item as described and i can not say more but got help with my order fast,5
4946,coming from an old   this phone works great,5
4947,perfect  everything as described  received earlier than expected  no issues,5
4948,i ordered a rose gold iphone    phone arrived in perfect condition  exactly as advertised ,5
4949,phone was unable to connect when taken to the apple store  they tried multiple times  had to return the phone ,1
4950,over and over have i gone back and forth with att trying to get it unlocked  finally gave up and now it is just a waste of money sitting around my house ,1
4951,so far so good   looks and works like new at considerably less than new price ,5
4952,got this for my in laws and they love it   price condition and having a phone that works,5
4953,warning  the buyers must double think before they fall in a trap    it stopped on the   day and i can’t return it because the returning policy is with in   days  i have to trash  it the screen gets darker  you can’t see nothing and there is no one can fix it ,1
4954,this iphone is an outstanding value  a great product ,5
4955,looks super nice  no visible damage  everything works well ,5
4956,the phone came i good condition but whe i receive calls  i can hardly hear  it’s not the volume either  i don’t want the hassle of sending it back so i just ordered ear buds  never will i purchase another used phone  you get what you pay for   sometimes,2
4957,i didn t pay attention and assumed that this was amazon refurbished so i didn t read the reviews  i have only been using the phone for a few hours because it took over   hours to charge the phone to     when i check the battery maximum capacity it is at    not what i would expect from a  refurbished  phone   i am also getting some weird behavior with the bluetooth it has been dropping connection with my car off and on  i am going to keep checking thing out but may return it if things keep going this way ,1
4958,great item  no issues delivery shipping packaging was unexpectedly great ,5
4959,i got it a day early  and it looks new to me ,5
4960,the phone came in great condition and well packed  the only disappointment i was that the over all battery quality was    total  having a iphone hr for over a year with the battery quality being    this was a letdown  definitely we going to return this phone ,2
4961,espectacular  sin rayones  sin ninguna marca   esta como nuevo  ,5
4962,it was good and it is being used for all purpose ,5
4963,i’ve had this phone for about a month and have had no problems,5
4964,yo this phone is soooo much faster than my   lol and it has insane battery life,5
4965,the battery doesn’t last long,3
4966,i’m use to bigger phones but ultimately a great buy ,5
4967,amazing buy this it works great  with verizon i’m writing this on the phone,5
4968,it is beautiful and light i soyd e ecuador and the iphone runs very well around here ,5
4969,i returned the phone already  there was a small crack in the back which it did say might be minor cosmetic wear so that’s okay i guess  but the reason i only gave one star is because i thought the phone was at t locked  but after talking to apple for an hour and talking to at t for an hour i came to find out the phone was cricket locked and that was the reason why my sim card wasn’t being accepted super frustrating situation to find out that was the case,1
4970,great phone  my niece loves it ,5

4974,great iphone   love how easy it was to set up ,5
4975,great deal  also came with   months of free service which was a great surprise  ,5
4976,this phone came in great condition  no scratches or marks  easy to set up  but the battery life was horrible  it only had    capacity and i couldn’t even get it to charge passed    while using it  lost about    of battery life in the ten min i used it  i would have kept the phone if it weren’t for the bad battery  great packaging and even came with a like new charger  but what good is a phone with out a decent battery ,1
4977,it’s great,5
4978,it’s better than my old phone  it’s perfect,5
4979,everyday use,5
4980,if i could give a zero i would  phone arrived with the screen installed incorrectly   it sits too high causing the home button too be depressed but since the screen sits above the phone casing it cracks easily around the edges   still waiting for the company to reply with an answer to return it   i’m not holding my breath and will have to repair it myself ,1
